# Eetu Suikkanen's Website

This project is a personal website for Eetu Suikkanen, a composer from Finland. The website includes a main page and a blog subpage, both designed to showcase Eetu's music, projects, and writing process.

  - A main content area for displaying blog posts, each with a title, date, and content area.
  - A footer consistent with the main page.

- **images/**: A directory containing images used throughout the website, including logos for light and dark modes.
