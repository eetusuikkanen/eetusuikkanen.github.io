      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;musescore-issues&#34;&gt;Musescore issues&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I switched over to Linux, I had been using Steinberg&amp;rsquo;s Dorico as my notation software, and had been really happy with it.&#xA;But sadly getting Steinberg software running in Linux via WINE turned out to be a pain in the ass, so I decided to just start using Musescore instead, since that one is a Linux native app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the whole user experience in Dorico is so well made, that using other apps after that feels really slow and cumbersome, because of the fast and easy workflow that Dorico has thanks to the Popover system they&amp;rsquo;ve created.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Musescore before, and made the sheet music for my last impressions jam submission using it, but it still feels a lot slower to use compared to Dorico.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m sure if I would keep using it, I would get a bit faster with it, but I encountered an issue that made me look for a way to keep using Dorico even if my main OS is linux.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-my-change-of-distro&#34;&gt;On my change of distro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So.. In my previous post I was using Fedora as my distribution, and that was because everytime I&amp;rsquo;ve demoed linux for a few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve always tried a new distribution each time and had already tried out &lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Studio&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Manjaro&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;EndevourOS&lt;/strong&gt;  previously, So I decided to try out &lt;strong&gt;Fedora&lt;/strong&gt; for music production this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been running &lt;strong&gt;Fedora&lt;/strong&gt; on my laptop for a long time now and had used it previously for a server machine that I used to host a &lt;strong&gt;Mumble&lt;/strong&gt; voip server.&#xA;So naturally that made me want to test how easy/hard setting it up for music prodction would be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-this-is-about&#34;&gt;What this is about&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the basic version of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Copilot for Visual Studio became free to use, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying it out by making tweaks to this website I had already previously made.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using Copilot as help, I made this new &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; section to the site, and ported over my old blog posts from my wordpress site, just so everything was under one domain name. And for just basic html and css stuff, It&amp;rsquo;s worked great, albeit It got a bit stuck in a loop trying to fix something and It needed the me to tell it what to fix by holding its hand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-jam&#34;&gt;Before the jam&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Haven‚Äôt written any music since the last Impressions Jam, so this will hopefully get me to make something üòÑ, and also a good change to give my linux audio setup a proper test to see how holds up in actual use cases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve used in linux before in a previous Impressions jam, but I had some issues getting my non native sample libraries working without performance issues (EW Play, Kontakt).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-setup&#34;&gt;Initial setup&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been playing around with making music on Linux every now and then with some jam projects, but after trying different distributions and learning about what I need to run some of my Windows software on Linux, I finally decided to take the plunge fully and try to swap fully over even if I had to give up some of the orchestral/acoustic sample libraries I couldn‚Äôt get running.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Started this jam pretty much the same way I do every time, meaning I started noodling/improvising ideas with piano while looking at the theme prompts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I pretty quickly got a little melodic figure that I liked and then improvised a sketch playing around with it, intending to take a break after that and continuing forward from the sketch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://eetusuikkanen.github.io/posts/images/imprs-imag-2-init-melody.webp&#34; alt=&#34;image info&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ended up getting a bit side-tracked by the Anniversary update to Half Life 2, so didn‚Äôt work on the jam for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As soon as I saw the picture and text themes, I felt like doing some neoclassical inspired stuff would fit the themes this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been listening to Kirill Pokrovsky‚Äôs music a lot lately, so i originally thought about doing something a bit similar to how the music he made for the Divinity games sounded, but after improvising some ideas out in the daw I decided to change over to Musescore and maybe do the whole submission as 1 big suite type orchestral thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;time-to-do-some-atmospheric-stuff-i-guess&#34;&gt;Time to do some atmospheric stuff I guess?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Decided to use Cubase for this jam, after trying/learning Reaper for some jams/couple of months now. And in true authentic Cubase style, I managed to get Cubase to crash after only an hour üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Came up with a short 3 note figure/motif pretty quickly after starting to improv some ideas on a piano and started to sketch out some sort of a ambient/atmospheric track around a piano improv/sketch I recorded riffing around the 3 note motif I came up with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;trying-to-establish-a-virtual-space-with-reverbs&#34;&gt;Trying to establish a Virtual Space with Reverbs?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Found a &lt;a href=&#34;https://vi-control.net/community/threads/poor-mans-multi-mic-room-hall-reverb.133917/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt; talking about blending dry sounds with other more ‚Äúwet‚Äù sounds by using Convolution reverbs with different IR‚Äôs recorded at different spots in a room as Busses you send your tracks to, and then control the send levels like you would a ‚Äúmic mix‚Äù in a sample library.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Took me a bit to understand the basic principles of how it works, but when I got it setup correctly, I found that it worked GREAT! The different ‚ÄúMics‚Äù that you can mix felt much easier to tweak than using a reverbs Pre-delay values and whatnot to try and make things sound farther/closer away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Alternative Soundtrack - music jam #2: Daily Journal</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-sketch&#34;&gt;Initial sketch&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First thing I do every jam, is to first get some ideas from the theme while playing the piano, and then record a long continuous take improvising around those ideas. Then I listen back a bit later, and if anything sounds good to me, I start working on from that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the jam started on a Friday for me and I was going to have no time during the weekend, I made a quick sketch of a faux Bossa Nova track, after listening to a track from the Animal Crossing: New Horizons soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
