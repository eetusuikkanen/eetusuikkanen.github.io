I'm a Finnish composer, mostly writing music in varying styles, but might dapple in some other creative endevours every now and then.

This site serves mostly as a blog for the various jam events I take part in, and for some occasional posts about other stuff I'm playing around/experimenting with, but might include other stuff in the future as well.
