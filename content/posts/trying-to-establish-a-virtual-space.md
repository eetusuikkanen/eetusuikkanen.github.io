## Trying to establish a Virtual Space with Reverbs?
Found a [forum post](https://vi-control.net/community/threads/poor-mans-multi-mic-room-hall-reverb.133917/) talking about blending dry sounds with other more “wet” sounds by using Convolution reverbs with different IR’s recorded at different spots in a room as Busses you send your tracks to, and then control the send levels like you would a “mic mix” in a sample library.

Took me a bit to understand the basic principles of how it works, but when I got it setup correctly, I found that it worked GREAT! The different “Mics” that you can mix felt much easier to tweak than using a reverbs Pre-delay values and whatnot to try and make things sound farther/closer away.

I looked around for some Impulse Responses (IR) that had multiple positions of a room recorded and found an IR set of the Concert Hall in Pori, here in Finland, and those IR’s worked great on my first test sketch track I made to test this setup. [Find them here](http://legacy.spa.aalto.fi/projects/poririrs/).

Going to try and record some vocal stuff and try to get them to blend with the other sample sounds I have, which hopefully wont be too much of a headache with this “mic mix” style of reverb.

Another great resource for working with samples/mock-ups I stumbled upon, was this [GDC talk by the Composer Wilbert Roget](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023727/AAA-Virtual-Orchestration-on-an). It’s about an hour long talk on how he worked on “Lara Croft and the Temple Of Osiris” using virtual orchestra sounds and some live recorded instruments. Highly recommend watching the whole thing since there’s a lot of good stuff he talks about.
