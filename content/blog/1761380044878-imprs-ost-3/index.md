# Day 1
## Morning
Before the theme was announced for this jam I was intending to do some sort of fantasy jrpg adjacent stuff with snes sounds, but with themes being space themed paintings I'm not so sure about that anymore ðŸ˜…

So since I'm not set on what the heck I'm going to use for sounds, I'll first come up with an initial idea on the piano that I hopefully can then just arrange the parts from after I get a feel for what sounds to use...

This time around I decided I'm not going to avoid the sort of *template* elements that I tend to gravitate towards subconsciously (i.e constant bVI-bVII- i usage, 4th/5ths progressions and sequences etc..) and just go with the flow of what comes out of my head ðŸ˜„

Half an hour later I got a bit heroic theme going that I liked (albeit a bit too generic maybe ðŸ˜…) and started to work onwards from that, coming up with 2 other sections and other stuff 

After a few hours I got a minute and a half long sketch/base for the theme track in an OK state and since I still had 0 ideas on the instrumentation, I decided to stop for now and come back later in the evening when I'm back.
### Initial sketch for the Theme

# Day 3

### Evening

Tried to arrange something from the initial piano sketch yesterday, but the result was really crappy so I'm not even sharing that here ðŸ˜‚, and because of that I started a new track today in a completely different DAW to make things fresh

I've always used Reaper in Linux during jams, but I had heard a lot of good things about Bitwig from people in the OST Composing Jam community and since it has a Linux version, I decided to take the 30 day trial and give it a shot

First impressions of using it for a few hours is that it feels a bit similar to Cubase in a lot of ways, with the track inspector on the left, lower zone with the mixer/piano roll, and the media/plugin browser on the right.

The keybindings are different of course so the similarity in the UI makes me keep pressing Cubase keybinds accidentally ðŸ˜….

Overall Bitwig feels pretty great, but still feels a bit slow to use since I don't know all the mouse modifiers and gestures, but I like that it has the same right click menu to switch between the DRAW, MOUSE, SLICE tools just like Cubase had (although sometimes I can't trigger that menu and it only triggers the basic menu instead...)

For this new track I just browsed the stock sound/plugins in Bitwig and started noodling ideas and then just recorded what felt OK

I started out with a drumbeat that I played thing on top of, which kind of led to the whole track having this constant 4 on the floor dance/club track feel

The track it self feels ok, but fitting to theme? Thats a whole other thing ðŸ˜…   I'm going to probably have to think of an actual made up game which I'm writing for, since without that to "guide" me in a direction I probably will just keep getting stuck/making things that feel *off-theme*....

And as I write this addition later at night, I actually found a nice little MIT licensed godot space shooter demo game, and I think I'll use that as the game and try and write a menu/main theme, some stage/level music and maybe a mission complete/victory tune.

The demo game only has a never ending gameplay loop, but maybe I can try and script a score goal that then goes to a STAGE COMPLETE thing, and from there the player then heads to the next level and so on

I'm not a programmer, but maybe I can somehow set all of that up (or VIBE CODE it ðŸ˜‰), since I really like having a little demo game to hear the music in context like I did for the previous Mystery jam + this time I can actually make the demo playable from the browser!

### Will this be THE GAME?
