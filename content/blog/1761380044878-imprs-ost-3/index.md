## Day 1
### Morning
Before the theme was announced for this jam I was intending to do some sort of fantasy jrpg adjacent stuff with snes sounds, but with themes being space themed paintings I'm not so sure about that anymore ðŸ˜…

So since I'm not set on what the heck I'm going to use for sounds, I'll first come up with an initial idea on the piano that I hopefully can then just arrange the parts from after I get a feel for what sounds to use...

This time around I decided I'm not going to avoid the sort of *template* elements that I tend to gravitate towards subconsciously (i.e constant bVI-bVII- i usage, 4th/5ths progressions and sequences etc..) and just go with the flow of what comes out of my head ðŸ˜„

Half an hour later I got a bit heroic theme going that I liked (albeit a bit too generic maybe ðŸ˜…) and started to work onwards from that, coming up with 2 other sections and other stuff 

After a few hours I got a minute and a half long sketch/base for the theme track in an OK state and since I still had 0 ideas on the instrumentation, I decided to stop for now and come back later in the evening when I'm back.

## Day 3

### Evening

Tried to arrange something from the initial piano sketch yesterday, but the result was really crappy so I'm not even sharing that here ðŸ˜‚, and because of that I started a new track today in a completely different DAW to make things fresh

I've always used Reaper in Linux during jams, but I had heard a lot of good things about Bitwig from people in the OST Composing Jam community and since it has a Linux version, I decided to take the 30 day trial and give it a shot

First impressions of using it for a few hours is that it feels a bit similar to Cubase in a lot of ways, with the track inspector on the left, lower zone with the mixer/piano roll, and the media/plugin browser on the right.

The keybindings are different of course so the similarity in the UI makes me keep pressing Cubase keybinds accidentally ðŸ˜….

Overall Bitwig feels pretty great, but still feels a bit slow to use since I don't know all the mouse modifiers and gestures, but I like that it has the same right click menu to switch between the DRAW, MOUSE, SLICE tools just like Cubase had (although sometimes I can't trigger that menu and it only triggers the basic menu instead...)

For this new track I just browsed the stock sound/plugins in Bitwig and started noodling ideas and then just recorded what felt OK

I started out with a drumbeat that I played thing on top of, which kind of led to the whole track having this constant 4 on the floor dance/club track feel

The track it self feels ok, but fitting to theme? Thats a whole other thing ðŸ˜…   I'm going to probably have to think of an actual made up game which I'm writing for, since without that to "guide" me in a direction I probably will just keep getting stuck/making things that feel *off-theme*....

And as I write this addition later at night, I actually found a nice little MIT licensed godot space shooter demo game, and I think I'll use that as the game and try and write a menu/main theme, some stage/level music and maybe a mission complete/victory tune.

The demo game only has a never ending gameplay loop, but maybe I can try and script a score goal that then goes to a STAGE COMPLETE thing, and from there the player then heads to the next level and so on

I'm not a programmer, but maybe I can somehow set all of that up (or VIBE CODE it ðŸ˜‰), since I really like having a little demo game to hear the music in context like I did for the previous Mystery jam + this time I can actually make the demo playable from the browser!

#### Will this be THE GAME?

## Day 4

### Evening

Today I decided to try to and arrange my piano sketch from Day 1 again, since now I had an idea of trying to do some eurodance/eurobeat-ish styled stuff.

I'd worked a bit on remixing an old track I did a long time ago using those sounds for the Impressions: Personal Project jam last year, but got a bit sick and ended up not finishing or submitting that track, so thought that this time I'll try that style and actually finish the tracks ðŸ˜‚

Like I previously mentioned, this jam I'm just going to go with the flow in regards to the music, so I came up with the actual material for the track pretty quickly by just trying out ideas on the piano.

For the sounds I mostly went with eurodance/eurobeat sounding presets from the **EURONAM** patch bank for the old **Synth1** synthesizer vst (great synth, and free!)

I initially laid down a basic house/eurobeat drum pattern and then just started jamming on the material I had come up with on the piano.

After recording those *jams* I then started arranging that to different parts, mostly following the basic eurobeat esque style of having the synth bass and some chordal synth stabs playing on the off beats giving the feeling momentum and then synth leads and brasses playing the lead melody parts and more fuller chordal stuff too on the choruses.

A bit on the midi recording in **Bitwig** that I found really confusing is that if I start recording a take with the playhead not directly on the grid, the recorded midi does not line up with the other midi stuff visually and is in some sort of stretch mode with stretch markers on the side of the midi editor for the data?  
I really hate that as a default setting and need to look up how to disable it or work around it, because its really getting on my nerves + the lack of retrospective midi recording which I've really grown dependent on from heavy usage of it in Cubase and Reaper ðŸ˜…

But hey, got a new track started at least and will see tomorrow if this style feels the right way to go!

## Day 5

### Evening

Listening back to yesterday's stuff, I still feel it will work, only the flow of the track felt a bit too jarring for me on the first listen.

Since I like the sound direction, I decided to give arranging the Day 1 sketch a new try and managed to get a rough version that I liked done in a few hours, bt then felt a bit ear fatigued and decided to stop working on that for the day.

Went with mostly the same sounds as the previous track as I did it in the same project file (might case issues later down the line...ðŸ˜…) and only added a retro dance piano sound that just played the original piano sketch in the background while I added the actual arrangement on top of it.

Having the piano in the background might be a bit too much, but its not on overpowering sound. so I felt it could work and will probably hear with fresh ears tomorrow if I need to just take it out ðŸ˜„

The style of the arrangement is pretty much just more of the same eurobeat esque stuff like the previous track had, so might be a bit too samey, but hey, at least they sound like they are from the same thing so that's something ðŸ˜‰

Anyway heres the new stage/level tune
