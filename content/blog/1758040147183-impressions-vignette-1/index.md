## Day 1

### Starting up

Just looking at the theme, all that comes to mind while trying to come up with ideas on the piano is my stuff for the last OST Composing jam 8, since that theme also had a woman looking thoughtful too...

Because of that I'm going to start by trying to come up with an idea by just inputting notes with the mouse, just to avoid the muscle memory from last jams stuff kicking in because of the similarities in the subjects on the paintings in both ðŸ˜…

Hopefully will get something going today.

### A bit later 

So... spent a few hour's trying ideas painstakingly inputting them with the mouse to a piano track, and got a little lydian dominant-ish thing I liked.

Now since its using lydian dominant, it sounds really playful and a bit goofy and might be a bit too much considering the mood of the woman in the image, but I did moody stuff in the last impressions jam and the OST Composing jam #8 before this one, so I decided to just do more up-beat stuff because I really hate doing the same type of stuff over and over again.

When starting to arrange from the skeleton I inputted before, I decided to use some strings playing pizzicato, since lydian dominant has that playful feel to it and I also wanted to test the pizzicato samples from the new string library I used in OST Jam #8, as I had only used/tried the legato/longs patches there.

Arranging was just mostly deciding which instruments play what line, and I mostly just put everything on the strings, putting some doubling on the woodwinds and harp in the first section, and then for the latter parts having the celesta take the lead, which then gets taken over by the woodwinds again (Oboe, Clarinet).

In the latter part and slightly at the end of the first part, I put a lot of the sections in 2 part divisi to get a little extra textural flavour since this library has actual divisi samples and wanted to test those in practice. and it worked pretty nicely in my opinion (at least feel like that for now..), but still feel that the switch from the first section to the later parts feels bit jarring with the celeste coming in and all, so will see if it still feels off after a break.
