I decided to do a second section from that, but decided to first make a little drumbeat to play over instead of the metronome, which took me a while to find sounds I liked.\nAfter recording a few takes over the drums, I took the one I was most happy with and started to arrange parts for the strings to play under the piano, but in the end the arrangement ended up a bit muddy feeling, but will take a break and listen back to it later in the day and find out then if it really is too muddy and needs fixing (also need to make/find some sort of a riser/sweep to make the change of parts smoother..).\nMorning Progress for the One Summer\u0026rsquo;s Night #\rEvening\nWas not really feeling like working on the first track anymore today, so I started out to make a new one.\nSince the first track is meant to be the Title Theme, I think this next one will be a sort of area/level background music, so something relatively soft and not too annoying.\nI did the same I did when coming up with the title theme, and just improvised around ideas that came to my head while looking at the themes, and got a short little idea that I recorded and started working from.\nThe idea kinda felt like some sort of a ON HOLD music to me, so it fit pretty well to the vibe that I get from the image, that felt like its someone that\u0026rsquo;s been waiting for something/someone for some time now.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t get a solid game idea from the painting yet, but preliminarily I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of a setting where the game starts with the person in the image waiting for someone, but that someone never comes and they then set out to look for them.\nSo in that sense the ON HOLD music feel felt the right way to go to me, all though it might need a lot of tweaking to not be too annoying 😅\nSpent an hour or so of trying few things, but ended with keeping the piano recording as it was recorded and then adding a harp and celeste doubling the melody, a soft synth pluck doubling the piano part (might need to prune some notes so its not too fat) and a cello playing a bass line.\nEvening start of new bgm track \u0026ldquo;WAITING\u0026rdquo; #\rDay 3 #\rSo\u0026hellip; I felt that the cello bassline was a bit too much for the soft ethereal ambience I had in mind for this track/area, so I just cut that out and added a Oboe doubling the melody in the later part of the section\nAfter those tweaks I started to try to come up with ideas for a second section for the track, which should be a bit contrasting to the first one, but not too different to feel like its a different track all together.\nTook a while, but in the end came up with a sort \u0026ldquo;variation\u0026rdquo; of the first section with the harmony and melody having some slight changes here and there to keep it new feeling but still having the same contour to the part.\nI also dropped the harp and celeste for this new section, tried out a few instruments to play the melody part, and ended up really liking the solo cello coming to double the melody and fill out the mid/low end nicely, which I feel felt really nice after the previous section being more higher register for the melody line.\nFelt done for the day after this, and stopped there.\nDay 4 #\rEvening I\nOn my first listen back to the track, I felt that the oboe had a bit too sharp of a tone for the vibe I was going with, and swapped it out for a flute instead, which always works nicely with the harp and celeste.\nFeeling like I cant add more to the second track at this moment, I will try to start a 3rd one.\nWAITING after additions #\rEvening II\nAfter a short break, I started to think about what the next track could be. The sort of idea for the game these would go in, I had a sort of silent hill-ish? adventure game in mind, where the girl in the picture is waiting for her someone at the docks, and after waiting sometime a figure who she recognizes appears at the end of the docks, she runs to hug them, only to phase through them like a ghost and falling in to the water, sinking deeper and deeper trying to reach out their hand while they lose their conciousness . The first track One Summers Night is meant to play during this sequence, that would be a sort of introductory cinematic.\nAfter that she wakes up in a weird place that seems devoid of life, where the player wanders around trying to figure out where the hell they are, and the second track Waiting is meant for that initial wandering around the place.\nBut after the player does/discovers things, the sun starts setting and some weird things would start to happen, making the player feel like they are not alone, or something like that.\nSo the new track would have to give a bit of a uneasy feeling, and hopefully make the listener feel somethings not right about the place.\nI thought about what to do for a while, but I then got the idea of taking the \u0026ldquo;main theme\u0026rdquo; from the intro sequence and twisting that around to make it feel a lot more creepy/dissonant.\nI started out by writing the new darker version of the theme and put that on the celli since it originally was with violins, and then wrote the harmony/counterlines with the rest of the string section.\nWhile doing that I remembered the old style of tension music in old movies and tv shows where they had violins playing a really high drone note to add tension, which I tried out and felt like it fit like a glove in the mix! A bit later I also remembered hearing a constant rhythmic pulse added on top of that with other instruments too, so I added the harp and piano doubling the high F# drone note with a constant 8th note pulse, which felt pretty great to me, but might be a bit too annoying depending on how long this track would play in-game (it maybe could be a separate dynamic tension layer?)\nI also added a little celeste flourish to the end, but thats just a placeholder, since I\u0026rsquo;m probably going to extend this, or do the ending so it can loop well.\nStill haven\u0026rsquo;t done anything more to the first track\u0026hellip; hopefully will get the mojo to fix the build to the big part on that before the time runs out 😅\nBut anyway, that\u0026rsquo;s all I got made today\nFirst version of the 3rd track! #\rDay 5 #\rEvening I\nListening back to yesterdays track (working title NIGHTFALL) I felt that it could use a more mellower 2nd section, so I got to trying out stuff for that.\nSince I had previously added the little celeste flourish at the end, I got the idea to replace the F# drone note with a little chord vamp on the celeste, where it just keeps repeating 2 half note chords every bar for the whole section, so there is something repetitive like on the previous part, just so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel too separate from what came before.\nSince I had used cello on the earlier area music that plays before things start to get weird for the character, I decided to use that again for the melody as sort of contrast to what it was in before. I tried out some woodwinds I used in the earlier track too, to have the melody on the second half of the section, but wasn\u0026rsquo;t feeling them for this context, so I tried out a solo violin instead and really liked it playing the melody together with the cello and its also playing it harmonized like the strings were in the previous part, with some slight differences at parts to have some interest to it.\nnow the track is pretty OK length wise, but probably needs a bit tweaking to the end if I want it to loop around to the beginning better, but it\u0026rsquo;s probably best do that stuff after a break with fresh ears.\nNIGHTFALL with new section #\rNight\nI was doing random testing with vocal stuff and chopping up samples of the other tracks hip hop style, and got some of those sounding pretty cool when pitched down.\nWhile playing around with those chops, I got a little groove idea that then evolved into some sort of a DANGER/ENEMY ALERT beat that I liked.\nSince its almost midnight now for me, I think ill listen back to this tomorrow and see if it still feels good and then try to continue it forward.\nNew track UNWELCOME #\rDay 6 #\rEvening\nListened back to yesterdays late night sample chop testing idea and it still felt good to me, only thing about it is that it might be a bit too different to all of the preceding tracks.\nListening to other jammers devlog posts in discord really made me wanna write something a bit more energetic, so the idea of the game my tracks were for kinda changed a bit to a more darker Silent Hill-ish direction 😅\nI feel the track could fit ok if I made a couple ambient tracks with a more industrial vibe for the world when the sun has set after NIGHTFALL, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if people want to listen to that kind of ambient stuff for multiple minutes during rating.\nAdded a second section to make it about a minute long now, which is probably an ok length. For the new section I added some of the solo strings that I had in NIGHTFALL before playing some melodies, which I\u0026rsquo;m feeling might be a bit too much and might cut those. I also remembered I discovered a cool bell sound a while back from one of those circular saw drill bits, which when struck produces a clear pitch that when sampled can work as a weird bell thing. So I sampled that of course, and put that on a Sampler track in Cubase and used that for some of the melody lines since it felt fitting to the sort of vibe I had in mind for the now a bit weird place we are in after NIGHTFALL.\nFelt pretty done for the day at this point and stopped there.\nUNWELCOME with new added section #\rDay 7 #\rEvening\nNow that I had made the small direction change for the fictional game, I felt that the second track WAITING felt too ethereal/bright for the style of game I envisioned, so first thing I started working on today was coming up with a new track to replace that one.\nI tried all sorts of things to modify the tonality and notes of WAITING to make it more dark and what not, but still felt off to me, which I decided to be the melody itself and decided to scrap the whole track.\nFor the new try at the WAITING track I decided to take the \u0026ldquo;main theme\u0026rdquo; I made for the game in ONE SUMMERS NIGHT, and change that to a more major-ish feel and have that be the intro track for that start as we are at the docks during sunset.\nI played around with just whole sale doing the same thing in major, but ended up with something not so \u0026ldquo;just the same thing in major\u0026rdquo; which I liked.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t have any arrangement ideas for it now, so might just keep it as solo piano, but then the sudden use of strings in nightfall might be a bit weird, but it is what it is I guess 😅\nFeeling pretty creatively done for today, so might just spend last days of the jam tweaking ONE SUMMERS NIGHT so its the best I can make it, and have it as the last track in my submission, with the order of tracks being WAITING-NIGHTFALL-UNWELCOME-ONE SUMMERS NIGHT, which feel like the way to go.\nLike I mentioned yesterday, I might try making one or two little ambient tracks, which I might have after NIGHTFALL and UNWELCOME, but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make the submission too long, so will see on the last day how it\u0026rsquo;ll be 😁\nNew track to replace WAITING, called WAITING?? 😅 #\rDay 8\nBeen feeling a bit creatively drained for the last few days regarding the jam, so didn\u0026rsquo;t do much other than slight tweaks here and there. I tried to continue making the title track ONE SUMMER\u0026rsquo;S NIGHT better, but still feeling really stuck on that one, so it might end being submitted in the state I got it after the first few jam days 😅\nSince I was stuck on doing anything on the current tracks, I decided start trying to make 1 or 2 ambient tracks to help have some chill stuff between the tracks, just so that the submission doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound too all over the place, like I mentioned yesterday.\nI sampled the opening piano chord from ONE SUMMER\u0026rsquo;S NIGHT latter section and put that on a sampler track, which I put the Speed setting on a low value, so when the sample is triggered, its played through very slowly, which got a nice texture of the rolled chord.\nI then put Cubase\u0026rsquo;s FX MODULATOR insert effect on it and used the Atmosphere Designer preset which I like, that preset has some effects that really slow down the audio signal, which always gets nice soundbed kinda thing out of sounds.\nI had that sort of droning in the background, with the midi played without a metronome, and I then played other sounds on top of that the same way.\nIn ambient stuff I always feel like using mellotron sounds (might just be because I\u0026rsquo;ve listened tangerine dreams rubycon album a lot 😁)\nKontakt Factory Library bank has some nice Mellotron samples, so I loaded up the Mellotron Flute patch and started playing some melodic stuff over the drone, slightly mimicking the ONE SUMMER\u0026rsquo;S DAY\u0026rsquo;S melody\u0026rsquo;s A# to G motion to have a bit of continuity between the tracks.\nThen I used my mic to record some light piano stuff from my digital piano\u0026rsquo;s speakers, just as an experiment I\u0026rsquo;ve never done before, which worked ok for this thing, probably because I have a really long wet reverb as insert on everything, so everything gets kinda mushed together to a soup of sound.\nNew ambient track REFLECTIONS #\rSince this was a quick one for me, I felt like trying to make the second one right after.\nSince I had a slight Silent Hill inspiration for the setting, I wanted to give a try making a trip hop influenced track, albeit only in that I was going to use a drumbreak to play stuff over 😅\nStarted playing around with the opening Cmin7 chord to G motion from One Summers Night again (I know, becoming a bit of a one trick pony over here 😂) but after some thinking decided to keep the A# to G motion in to top notes/melody, but changed the G chord to a Gmin7 instead to make it more dark, then vamp between those to have a steady groove.\nThat felt good to me, but after jammin around ideas on what other stuff to do so it\u0026rsquo;s not just that vamp all of the track, I ended up having a bit too much fun just jamming stuff and ended up with a more energetic take that I liked even more, so the track ended up being a more uptempo lounge? tune instead, with an electric bass added to play a bassline under the piano.\nThis more energetic track lead me to think of how it would be if the sort of main antagonist of the silent hill purgatory place the girl gets trapped in would just be chilling in a club area in the game, where you had to go back to again and again to progress, and as background music he would be on the stage singing a sort of \u0026ldquo;must be tough for you 😉\u0026rdquo; sneering song, with the lyrics mocking/making fun the player.\nIt took quite a while for me to come-up with lyrics I at least somewhat liked, but for starters I feel they work somewhat ok, I will probably tweak them later, but now I could at least record some test vocals to see how they feel.\nFrom the test takes, I feel the idea can work, but I need to listen back again tomorrow and iron out any lyrics I don\u0026rsquo;t like + the test vocals I did sound a bit too nasal now that I listen to them after a break, so need to keep that in mind when recording new ones 😅\nNew track OTHERSIDE #\rDay 9 #\rSo, after listening back to yesterdays new track, I still really liked the whole thing, so naturally I then spent the rest of the day trying to arrange it further and make it really polished.\nI had a bit of a tough time coming up with arrangement ideas, but after switching out the old drumbreaks out for some more modern drum beats that fit the rhythm of the track, I managed to get a flow state going and the arrangement just started to assemble bit by bit (did take me the whole day).\nI started out with doing some strings parts, mostly since those have been a sort of main instrument throughout the tracks, but now as I write this I realized I haven\u0026rsquo;t used the solo strings that I\u0026rsquo;ve had on previous tracks\u0026hellip; but maybe it\u0026rsquo;s better this way, since there\u0026rsquo;s already a lot of stuff.\nAfter doing some string lines and doubling of the piano during the chromatic triplet ascends and descends, I started to try and put in some horn parts since I felt like that would fit this type of track.\nI already had a sax doubling a synth lead in the first iteration of the track, so I muted that for now and picked up the one dry horn sample library I have, that being Session Horns, which has sampled trumpets, trombones, and saxophones.\nSince I only have the lite version of Session Horns, I only have the sort of \u0026ldquo;ensemble\u0026rdquo; patch it has, with the instruments it has laid out on the keys and the library has a so called Smart Voice Split function that splits notes to different instruments depending on the register when you play more than one note at a time.\nSo I started out by having the section accent the notes at some parts, and after that got ideas for doubling the harmony by doing some long pad notes to make parts feel more full.\nAfter that I was going to remove the sax and synth tracks which I was no longer using, but then felt like giving the tenor sax sound I had used previously a try. The sound I had used was a patch from Cubase\u0026rsquo;s stock Halion Sonic library, but when I started trying out some melodic stuff with it, I found that the patch actually had some different articulations, with the one named Growl being the one that really made me like it.\nThe Growl articulation had that nice buzzing/sharp tone to it that I\u0026rsquo;ve always liked when I\u0026rsquo;ve listened to T-Square and Honda Masato\u0026rsquo;s sax tone on their tracks.\nSo inspired by that I actually made the sax pretty much the lead instrument on the latter part of the song, which hopefully wont take too much from the vocals when I start to try record those tomorrow\u0026hellip; 😅\nSpeaking of vocals, I need to come up with a few more lyrics tomorrow and then really try to get the best vocal takes I can get with my meager skills\u0026hellip; Hopefully will at least get somewhat OK takes so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to scrap the vocals all together, since I spent quite a bit of time coming up with the lyrics 😁\nOTHERSIDE now with an actual arrangement? #\rDay 10 #\rDawn of the final day?\nThe first thing I did today, was master the other tracks to a somewhat similar volume, and then I spent the rest of the time trying to come up with additional lyrics and trying (and failing) to record proper vocal takes.\nI had to stop working on OTHERSIDE when I realized there\u0026rsquo;s only a few hours to go till the submission deadline, and since I still felt the vocal takes were not that great and I kept slurring some words while singing, I decided to upload a second version of the track without the vocals, even if the track might feel a bit empty without them.\nSo next I tried to mix and master OTHERSIDE the best I can in a short time and then made the itch project page to finally submit them + the YouTube video and maybe a scritch player for the project page if I have time left after everything else.\nOkay at this point I\u0026rsquo;m pretty much done? I\u0026rsquo;ve submitted the project with all the info I usually try to provide, the youtube videos are uploaded and linked on the submission page, I even got the scritch player done (still uploading to itch, so fingers crossed it works 😅).\nNow it\u0026rsquo;s just uploading this blog post to my github page and link this to the submission page for anyone who wants to read my ramblings, and if that person is you reading this right now, congrats on getting to then of this without skipping anything, right? 😉.\nAnyway, thats all for me.\nFinal submission #\r","date":"7 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757950802962-ost-composing-jam-8/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"OST Composing Jam 8","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"7 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ostcomposingjam/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ostcomposingjam","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rDay 1 #\rLike on every jam, kinda just started out by feeling the vibe from the theme image, which gave me a bit of an majestic but bittersweet feel, with how only that spot had a clearing in the clouds and sunlight beaming down on the wrecked ship and the iceberg.\nBased on those feels, I started trying out different melodic stuff that came to mind while improvising and then felt one of them was pretty OK, and decided to stop there for the morning and come back later with fresh ears.\nLater in the afternoon when I listened to the melody I came up with in the morning, It felt a bit drunk/wonkily played, but the notes and figures still sounded good to me, so I started to refine that initial idea to be a bit better. Usually when I come up with a basic melody/motive, I like to then start recording piano improv stuff around that idea, while trying out different approaches of using the melody, and then taking the one I like the most and then working upwards from that.\nBut really have 0 ideas on what type of stuff or sounds i\u0026rsquo;m going to do/use, Ambient? Orchestral? Synths? Acoustic Instruments?, so I\u0026rsquo;m stopping here for today and then hopefully with fresh ears and mind, tomorrow I\u0026rsquo;ll get some ideas on where to go forward from this piano skeleton track.\nPiano skeleton of the first idea: #\rDay 1 cont. #\rI said I would stop for the day, but got some weird burst of energy late at night and split up the sketch to individual lines/voices and put those on a string section.\nInitial arrangement test: #\rEetu Suikkanen · latenightstrings Day 2-3 #\rAfter arranging the sketch for strings, it took me a bit to think of what instrumentation I would add with them, and I finally decided to add some woodwinds, choir and light percussion (timpani, bass drum, chimes) to the end climax part of the track, which worked pretty nicely for the sort of majestic, slightly bittersweet feeling I got from the painting.\nThat was what I got done on Day 2, but on Day 3 I started to tackle the earlier parts of the track, since it was just strings at the moment, I wanted to add some doubling to give a bit more colour to the parts. Since I initially had come up with the main melody while playing around on a English Horn sound, I wanted to have the English Horn playing the melody here too, which I put doubling the melody when the track starts building up after intro, with a flute coming to double the backing melody a bit after.\nAfter that I felt like the parts before the climax had enough stuff already, and couldn\u0026rsquo;t come up with anything that I liked, so I took a new look at the climax part and tried out adding some chromatic percussion (celeste, vibraphone) and harp playing some quick arpeggios to add more feeling of momentum/building to it, and felt that it actually sounded pretty nice after I got the dynamics so that they would blend well with the rest of the ensemble.\nNow I was really out of ideas, and felt the track was in a good state, so I stopped here for the day.\nNow with added instruments: #\rEetu Suikkanen · latenightstring 1_3 Day 5 #\rSo\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s been a few days, and I haven\u0026rsquo;t really done anything to the track. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a few times to come up with more ideas to add to the track, but the track feels pretty complete to me as it is, just maybe needs a softer intro.\nSo as it has happened multiple times before, I was just noodling around with the main theme on the piano late at night, and suddenly came up with this sort of minor version of the melody, that is not exactly the same thing in minor, but slightly different, that I felt might work as an intro section before the big orchestra parts.\nI made the intro parts melody be slightly different, so that when it changes to the lydian version on the orchestral parts the change would feel more powerful with the mood shifting to a more uplifting feel.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll keep the intro as just solo piano, or if I\u0026rsquo;ll arrange it to something, but if I keep it as just solo piano, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably need to clean up the midi of my performance to make it not sound so sloppily played, or maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll just leave it as is for the human factor, even if its a bit crap at parts 😁.\nThe new piano sketch leading into the orchestra #\rFinal Day #\rAfter trying ideas for the rest of the jam, I really didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like the piano sketch needed to be arranged to anything, so I decided to keep it just as Solo Piano.\nSince its the final day and all for me, I tried to get the bridge from the piano intro to the orchestra smoother. I added a vibraphone and harp playing some rolled repeats of the final sus chord from the piano, a triangle and crotales for some added rhythm with them playing first then the rolled chords on the next measure, to hopefully give a feeling that somethings coming.\nI still feel that the transition to the orchestra is a bit off, or at least it still feels like that to me, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t really get any more ideas and its the final day, so I best get this done and submitted before I forget 😁.\nClosing thoughts #\rFeels like this jam ended up being one those where I get really inspired on the first few days and get a lot done, and then just feel like I cant do anything more to the track.\nAfter day 3 was the moment where I realized it was going to happen again, and lo and behold, I only managed to get a piano skeleton sketch for the intro parts and never got the inspiration/feeling to actually arrange them\u0026hellip;\nI was a bit 50/50 if I should just cut out the whole intro part since I couldn\u0026rsquo;t actually arrange it and going from solo piano to orchestra makes the whole orchestra feel a lot less powerful, but since I liked the material itself on it, I decided to just keep it in, even if it makes the whole orchestra part feel smaller.\nI should\u0026rsquo;ve added the piano somewhere in the arrangement of the orchestra part, but as I mentioned, I\u0026rsquo;m really feeling uninspired to work more on the track, so it is what it is I guess\u0026hellip;😅.\nFinal Submitted Track #\r","date":"24 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757949610654-impressions-ambience-3.md/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Impressions Composing Jam: Ambience #3","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/daw/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Daw","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIt finally feels great! #\rI\u0026rsquo;ve tried to get a sort of orchestral template set up in my DAW for well over a year now, but I\u0026rsquo;ve always had a lot of trouble getting the all instruments play on time, since all the different articulations have different amount of attack to the samples. I had kept trying to work with 1 track per instrument using expression maps, but this meant I could only set 1 track pre-delay value and that could not work with legato articulation requiring a lot more pre delay than say short notes.\nSo I finally caved in and set up a template where I had all the articulations I use for the instruments in different tracks, and this meant that the amount of tracks in my project file would increase x5 times which I\u0026rsquo;d wanted to avoid all this time to keep it more clean.\nBut after doing a short arrangement of my track The Trek from my submission Long Road Home for the the impressions jam, I found that after identifying the predelay values while working on the arrangement, I could have everything on the grid and it would play correctly I was really surprised (the sampled crescendos of course needed some nudging to find the sweet spot\u0026hellip;).\nI\u0026rsquo;m really feeling stupid now, since I could\u0026rsquo;ve just said fuck it to the large track amount and tried this a long time ago instead of wasting a year trying to make expression maps work for me 😂\nBut anyway, maybe try to use the articulation per track approach instead of expression maps if you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble with them.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the short arrangements of The Trek and the 2 battle tracks from FOX QUEST (Ancient Evil, Encounter) that I arranged from old jam tracks, using the new template.\nTemplate demo #\r","date":"5 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757949662705-on-my-new-template/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"On My New Cubase Template","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"27 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/linux-adventures/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Linux Adventures","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rWhy? #\rI had been really happy with Linux overall, and really enjoyed the custom setup I had made on EndevourOS, but like on my previous attempts, I found out that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t live without Kontakt.\nSince running/authenticating Kontakt through WINE is a everchanging pain in the butt + I had just snagged a great sample library from a sale that I was really looking to get to use, I decided to just bend the knee to the big corpo microsoft and return back to windows for now.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not abandoning using linux, but I will probably keep my workstation on windows for now, at least until my audio software/plugins get linux support, or using them via WINE/Yabridge gets less annoying/stable.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been using linux on my laptop for a long time now, but I have a crippling FOMO with playing around using sounds in Kontakt, so the Linux Adventures are on hold for me for now.\nExperience #\rEven if using windows plugins and software is a pain in linux, its understandable because you are using un-supported software through compability layers after all.\nAnd most of the issues is not regarding performance, since that only takes a minor hit even with wine in between, but the issue is DRM for every software, and that is the real pain, especially with NI stuff, since the Native Access needs a lot of tweaking to get working and then breaks on the next update.\nThat was the primary reason for my return to windows.\nBut if one uses only native software and plugins, the whole experience is great!

But sadly getting Steinberg software running in Linux via WINE turned out to be a pain in the ass, so I decided to just start using Musescore instead, since that one is a Linux native app.\nUnfortunately the whole user experience in Dorico is so well made, that using other apps after that feels really slow and cumbersome, because of the fast and easy workflow that Dorico has thanks to the Popover system they\u0026rsquo;ve created. I\u0026rsquo;ve used Musescore before, and made the sheet music for my last impressions jam submission using it, but it still feels a lot slower to use compared to Dorico. I\u0026rsquo;m sure if I would keep using it, I would get a bit faster with it, but I encountered an issue that made me look for a way to keep using Dorico even if my main OS is linux.\nThe issue that came up, was that I had been using the free MuseSounds samples for all the orchestral sounds in the app, but their servers had some issues one day, which made it so that my computer could not phone home to check if I had licenses for the FREE samples I\u0026rsquo;m using, so they deactivated themselves and could not be used\u0026hellip;\nI understand that complaining about issues in a free product is a bit stupid, but having a always online DRM on a free sample library is really weird\u0026hellip;.\nSo because of that I just said fuck it, and decided to try and see if Dorico could run OK inside a windows virtual machine.\nI installed VMware Workstation as my hypervisor/virtual machine manager of choice, since the basic free version has everything I need and its a lot more performant than something like VirtualBox, and having an actual GUI to edit things without needing to go manually edit config files is great, since I\u0026rsquo;ve used virtual machines before, but I\u0026rsquo;m no expert 😁\nSetting things up #\rSetting up the machine was pretty simple since I\u0026rsquo;ve used these before quite a bit. I created a virtual disk for the OS, with a reasonable size of 60GB, since I\u0026rsquo;m not going to install anything else other than Dorico and maybe some Affinity apps on it, and they don\u0026rsquo;t take that much space.\nThen I set up the rest of the settings like ram (8gb) and gave it most of the cpu power, and installed good old windows 7 on it.\nAfter that its just setting up all the Steinberg software and licensing stuff and install Dorico, which Is the same as it works on a standard windows install, + after Dorico was installed I also installed NOTEPERFORMER which is a fabulous soundset for Dorico and Sibelius that makes writing orchestral music in notation so smooth, since it has great playback (it\u0026rsquo;s also one of the reasons I went away from musescore, since they do not have support for it 😁)\nAfter all that, I copied the project file for my track CIVILIZATION that I made for one of the impressions jams, and to my surprise, I\u0026rsquo;t played back without issue. Even the whole Dorico software worked just like it had on my previous Windows setup, which is good news! Moving around in the score was slightly laggy, but that was on my older setup too, and usually happens in all notation software when you have a really large score with multiple staves (a full orchestra with choir in this case).\nAt this point I was pretty much set, since now I can just boot in to the windows VM to use dorico, and I don\u0026rsquo;t really keep the notation app open at the same time as the DAW anyway, since I usually write the whole thing first in notation before heading to the daw, so the extra cpu load and what not from having it in a VM doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter to me.\nThe windows virtual machine successfully running Dorico! Extra QOL fiddling #\rSince this machine was going to be mostly used for that one purpose I wanted to have easy access to boot up the VM without needing to first open the VMware player, select the VM and then press START THIS MACHINE, so I googled a bit and learned that making a bash script was the best option.\nVMware has a command vmrun that you can use to run the selected VM without opening the main app, and that was exactly what I needed.\nMaking the script ended up being pretty simple, and works like making a .bat script file in windows. So when I run the file I named doricovm.sh from my start menu it runs this terminal command in the background, which boots up my Windows 10 VM with Dorico in it, and since virtual machines can save their state on closing it, it opens up with Dorico already open ready to go from whatever I had been doing last, which is great!\nThe bash script in question:\n#!/bin/bash #Start the Dorico VM vmrun start \u0026#34;/mnt/musicprod/6 Virtual Machines/Windows 10 x64/Windows 10 x64.vmx\u0026#34; gui Now it opens on its own by just running the script which is a lot faster now, which I like a lot. Next I wanted to see if I could make it open on a separate virtual desktop so I can keep it fullscreen there and then move to another virtual desktop if I need to use the internet, since I intend to keep that VM offline, just so Windows doesn\u0026rsquo;t start to do any shenanigans with updates 😉\nFrom googling about options on how to do that on my desktop enviroment (KDE Plasma 6), a lot of people recommended using KWIN scripts to define the desktop for the app to open, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t get it to work that way. Luckily came across one person recommending to kinda do the same thing, but via the Special Application Window Settings menu, which is exactly the same as the KWIN script menu, but somehow different (KDE has a lot of option menus that look/do the same thing to me, but are not really the same😅).\nAfter doing the same setup there, I tried booting the VM from the script and It booted straight to Virtual Desktop 3, just like i wanted it to! Now everything works great, and I\u0026rsquo;m really looking forward to a jam where I might get to trial out this Dorico setup.\nHow I\u0026rsquo;ve got my virtual desktops setup, Obsidian for notes on Desktop 1 NOTE, browser and daw etc. on Desktop 2 MAIN and now the windows VM for Dorico on Desktop 3 VM\nProbably will still come up with some things I can tweak about this, but for now its pretty OK. When I will actually get to test drive this thing, is probably when I\u0026rsquo;ll find out what needs tweaking.\n","date":"14 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757949682759-on-my-preferred-notation-software/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"On my preferred notation software","type":"blog"},{"content":"\rOn my change of distro #\rSo.. In my previous post I was using Fedora as my distribution, and that was because everytime I\u0026rsquo;ve demoed linux for a few months, I\u0026rsquo;ve always tried a new distribution each time and had already tried out Ubuntu Studio, Manjaro, and EndevourOS previously, So I decided to try out Fedora for music production this time around.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been running Fedora on my laptop for a long time now and had used it previously for a server machine that I used to host a Mumble voip server. So naturally that made me want to test how easy/hard setting it up for music prodction would be.\nAnd like I mentioned on the first post in this series, it went pretty smoothly, mostly thanks to a lot of linux audio setup being the same across all distros.\nBut after getting my audio stuff up and running, I had updated my system and come across a really annoying issue that the new kernel update had brought with it, that issue being that I use my phone as a hotspot to get my internet connection since I\u0026rsquo;m still waiting for my ISP to install the fiber cables they\u0026rsquo;ve been promising to install for 2 years now\u0026hellip; (should hopefully be installed by the and of the year \u0026hellip;) And some changes in the new kernel made it so that linux does not recognize usb devices as modems anymore, so no internet connection for me\u0026hellip;\nThe issue can be circumvented by just rolling back to the previous kernel and Fedora has a great system where the OS always keeps the previous 3 kernel versions cached, probably for these kinds of situations, so I could just roll back to the previous kernel and everything works.\nBut after checking/waiting for the new kernel including the hotfix to come available, I found out the fun part of linux, where I would have to wait longer for the hotfix kernel since I was not on a rolling release/bleeding edge distro.. 😓\nSo after checking bodhi (fedora\u0026rsquo;s update system) daily to see if the new fixed kernel was on testing, or better yet, going to the stable branch, I just said Fuck it! and decided to switch to the distro I had used for a good half a year + before. And that distro was EndevourOS, which is a rolling release distro based on Arch Linux and would already have had the fixed kernel update for some time now.\nDuring my previous linux audio testing I had used EndevourOS for 2 itch.io composing jams and 1 Global Game Jam game, and had found the system to work without issues and the setup for audio had been been quick and simple, thanks to the pro-audio metapackage and all of Arch Wiki\u0026rsquo;s articles on PipeWire and Professional Audio, which contain a lot of useful info worth reading through when configuring the sample rate and Quantum in PipeWire.\nHaving a basic working music production setup in an Arch based distro is pretty simple with the packages provided in the Arch repository\u0026rsquo;s and the AUR user repos.\nOn my installation of EndevourOS I used the recommended quick setup from the Arch Wiki and just installed the pro-audio package group and the realtime-generic-setup AUR package, both of which which installed a big bundle of open-source instrument and fx plugins, some open-source DAWS and made a quick config setup for low latency audio respectively.\nAfter that the only other thing I needed for music production was installing Yabridge, which is available in the official Arch repos, so just running sudo pacman -S yabridge yabridgectl installed yabrige and the cli tool for it 😁\nThen I installed Reaper and got all my windows plugins installed via WINE, got those connected with Yabridge, and with that I was pretty much done with my setup.\nFirst \u0026ldquo;Real\u0026rdquo; test of my audio setup #\rNot long after I had done the switch to EndevourOS, I took part in the Impressions Composing Jam: Mystery #1 composing jam event, which was the first proper test of my hopefully new long lasting music production system.\nI started out with doing some orchestral music using EastWest\u0026rsquo;s Hollywood Orchestra, and the PLAY sampler VST it uses worked great via Yabridge and WINE! Kontakt on the other hand worked too, but I have this feeling that it\u0026rsquo;s performance is slightly worse compared to windows, but it\u0026rsquo;s not SO bad that it\u0026rsquo;s an issue to me.\nI did end up changing to a NES sound palette for the final jam submission, but I still was able to test and confirm that Kontakt and Play work OK enough.\nI did keep a little journal/devlog during that jam, which you can read here\nAfter the first jam test #\rAll in all the setup seemed to work smooth all throughout the jam, and I even made a little demo game for the music using RPGMAKER VX ACE via proton on Steam, so I could call it an all around success.\nI already knew it would work well from all the previous few month tests I had done the years before, but I was still pleased to find everything to work the same now.\nAfter the jam had ended, and I had managed to rate all of the other submissions in the jam, I got the idea to start messing about in the Godot game engine, using the integrated microsoft Copilot LLM bot in Visual studio since a free tier had become available.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve done a couple of small games before during a game programming optional subject/course while in school, but it was after going through those classes I really realized that programming was not for me and felt really hard to grasp and wrap my head around it, so I never did any programming after that, and have 0 knowledge and skills about it 😂\nBut working with Copilot I managed to get a little proof of concept of a text adventure game done, which im intending to continue after the free tier usage refreshes next month, since I already spent all of my \u0026ldquo;tokens\u0026rdquo; on the poc demo and some tweaking to the website by making a blog section and importing my wordpress blogs to my homepage 😅\nWhich turned out to be a waste, since I then pretty soon after remade the whole website using a static site generator\u0026hellip;\nWebsite overhaul #\rAs I mentioned before, I have ported over my blog from wordpress to this github pages site I use as my website.\nI initially had the page made with some html and css, and it worked great for just a little ABOUT ME page with links to all my profiles elsewhere. But after making a blog section with sub pages for all the post and their categories, the upkeeping became a bit of a nightmare, since every time I changed the navbar I needed to make the change to all pages and posts, which got a bit ridiculous, and writing the blog posts was really tedious with having to use all the HTML tags to add paragraphs and everything else.\nSo I decided to just take the plunge and learn how to use a static site generator, which would be a lot easier to use and manage.\nI had a friend recommend Astro before, but saw that a lot of people used and recommended HUGO, so decided to go with that, since with a large userbase there\u0026rsquo;s always a better change of finding a post about an issue you might come across.\nAfter watching a video about how it works and following the official quickstart tutorial, I got it setup without much issues, and started porting over all of my existing blog posts.\nThe good thing about static site generators is that there are a lot of premade themes available to choose from, and installing is as simple as just cloning the git repo to hugo\u0026rsquo;s theme folder and setting that as the theme in the config files.\nFor my site I really liked the look of the Poison theme by Luke Orth, and went with that.\nI found an issue in the theme where the About page does not appear in the sidebar menu, but thats not too bad of an issue since the main site URL opens that page as default, and my name also works as a link there.\nThe way content is written in hugo and other static site generators, is using markdown, which I was not really familiar with, but after I learned how making headers, links, bold, italics etc worked, It felt great! Compared to how cumbersome writing blog posts was in HTML, this felt like absolute bliss 😩\nI\u0026rsquo;m still learning the basic syntax and I just learned about Blockquotes while writing this post, but I hope all that stuff will turn to muscle memory at some point, so I dont need to read up on how it works every time I want to do a Blockquote or something else 😅\nI got all my blog posts ported over to the new site, wrote a new post and overall got things looking pretty OK and published the site, replacing the old one, with the new HUGO site being the site you are reading this in RIGHT NOW.\nI like how the site looks and functions overall as is now, but I feel like I need to look up if I can somehow get the about section to appear in the side menu, and then if I can also add a link to some form of POST CATEGORIES page, that would contain links to all of my different post categories for easy viewing (so for example, Linux Adventures, Jam Journals, Godot Experiments, etc.)\nHopefully thats possible with this theme without too much tweaking things needed, but at least for a start, I feel this page is pretty OK for now.\nIn conclusion #\rWith the audio setup working and the blog ported to my website, I\u0026rsquo;m feeling pretty happy with everything.\nSeeing as how my motivation on working with music is usually pretty much 0 unless its for some sort of a project, jam or something else, any other music proction testing will probably happen on the next Impressions jam, which starts in bit over a week.\nSince the Godot text adventure thing is on hold for now, untill i got the next free \u0026ldquo;tokens\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;ve started a little 2d hack and slash game.\nOn the 2d hack and slash game I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to get a moving character and a enemy that patrols around, that then chases to try and attack the player when they get too close, and can take damage from the players attacks and die.\nI think its a good start for now, and probably need to do some level design to get a proper large area with platforming and more enemies to fight.\nBut that might be on hold too for a bit, since I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten the itch to continue my Final Fantasy playthrough, where I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing all the original FF games I\u0026rsquo;ve never completed.\nI just finished FF 3, which was OK, but had some old school jank that could\u0026rsquo;ve used some QOL in the remasters, but I guess there would\u0026rsquo;ve been a bit of a backlash from the OG fans yelling \u0026ldquo;NO CHANGES!!\u0026rdquo; like vanilla wow had.\nNext up is FF 4, which luckily won\u0026rsquo;t have the job system from 3, which I had a bit of a love/hate relationship with 🙂\nBut anyway, thats all 👋\n","date":"30 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757949697003-reflections-after-a-few-months/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Reflections, a few months after switching...","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"24 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/godot-experiments/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Godot Experiments","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rWhat this is about #\rSince the basic version of Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Copilot for Visual Studio became free to use, I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying it out by making tweaks to this website I had already previously made.\nUsing Copilot as help, I made this new \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo; section to the site, and ported over my old blog posts from my wordpress site, just so everything was under one domain name. And for just basic html and css stuff, It\u0026rsquo;s worked great, albeit It got a bit stuck in a loop trying to fix something and It needed the me to tell it what to fix by holding its hand.\nSince making these blog pages was pretty smooth with it, I got the idea of trying out how Copilot would work with making games on Godot, since the dataset knows GDScript and how the engine works + I had made a little JRPG demo game in RPGMAKER for the Impressions Jam just a while back, and was still in the mood of making something.\nStarting up #\rAs soon as I opened Godot, I had the classic moment of having 0 ideas on what kind of a game I would even try to start making. Of course the smaller/less complex game the better, if a novice like me actually wants to actually get something finished 😂\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been playing the tabletop rpg game HERO QUEST every now and then with a friend group + after I played some of the old ZORK games god knows when, I\u0026rsquo;ve had the feeling that doing a text adventure type thing could be cool, so I got the idea to kinda combine the two and make a text adventure game where I just lazily use the setting, story, characters and mechanics of HERO QUEST in a text adventure game.\nSuprisingly setting up the basic base game mechanics and UI was not too difficult by working together with Copilot, and I got the setup done pretty quickly. I even got the bot to understand the rules and other logic of HERO QUEST, and it took that into consideration for the damage dice rolls and other stuff.\nAfter going a bit deeper in to adding a ascii art map and other stuff, it got a more problematic, where Copilot sometimes started doing the classic LLM hallucination about an issue that was not the issue it was told to look at. Sometimes the plugin also bugged out, where it would proudly declare \u0026ldquo;I have removed the thing that was an issue, that you told me to remove!\u0026rdquo; and then it actually didn\u0026rsquo;t remove it, requiring me to ask it \u0026ldquo;DID YOU REMOVE IT?\u0026rdquo; or just manually remove the lines myself.\nBut those things happened with my earlier HTML + CSS tests too, and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure a lot of the issues stem from the fact that I have all the game logic and systems inside 1 script, so Copilot gets confused and sluggish with so many lines of code to parse each query.\nBut nevertheless, I spent a few hours yesterday (when I started this test) and today, and managed to get some kind of \u0026ldquo;proof of concept\u0026rdquo; for the Hero Quest Text Adventure Game I had in mind.\nStill need to set up a proper turn based sort of system so enemies can strike back after you\u0026rsquo;ve successfully input a command, and try make the catacombs area bigger, with more rooms and enemies, but for starters its something at least.\nAbout gameplay #\rHow the game is played/works, is by typing commands on the input box on the bottom, so if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever played ZORK or that type of games, its the same thing.\nTo list all the available commands, type help and all the available commands are listed for you. There is also a music command that i forgot to add to the help info, which lets you control the volume by typing music 0, music 50, music 100 etc. to change the volume, or just type music off or music on to toggle the music\nAfter you finish the quest and defeat the gargoyle Verag, there appear some command to return to town etc. The return to town does not work atm since there is no town to go back to, but in future would work to return back from a succesfull quest and do the usual shopping etc that happens between quests in HERO QUEST\nAlso the quest is cleared when you defeat Verag, so when you find him, you need to use the attack command on him to attack him, this starts combat, where in the future there will be a turn based system in place, where after you attack him, he attacks back and so forth. Just keep attacking Verag untill you kill him and thats the Quest cleared! and the end of the demo 😄\nGive the rough version a try? #\rPlay in browser ","date":"24 June

linux audio setup a proper test to see how holds up in actual use cases.\nI’ve used in linux before in a previous Impressions jam, but I had some issues getting my non native sample libraries working without performance issues (EW Play, Kontakt).\nBut now that I’ve got my Hollywood Orchestra (Play version) and Kontakt working, I’m going to hopefully try and do some orchestral stuff for this jam to see if the WINE/Yabridge setup will work on an actual project.\nI made a quick template in reaper so i can just start writing as soon as the jam starts and I get an idea, but after a bit I came across a weird issue with the Play VST.\nAfter going over a certain amount of tracks using the Play VST, the plugin windows turned black or unresponsive (but still played sound and worked otherwise normally) and only returned to normal after i then turned some of the tracks off so I was not over the limit, which is really annoying since I cant edit the instruments if I have too many loaded at the same time.\nI’m not sure if i can fix that somehow, but since the jam starts soon I don’t want to accidentally break my WINE/Yabridge setup before that and will hopefully try to troubleshoot the issue after the jam 😅\nAnother issue I came across with using WINE for all my windows plugins, was that the license manager software ILOK that some plugins like PLAY from EastWest and all of the EVENTIDE and SOUNDTOYS plugins use resets the Machine ID everytime I update my WINE version.\nThis leads to ILOK thinking I’m on a new machine and then needs me to reactive all my licenses for this “new machine” it thinks I’m on, and someone at ILOK had the brilliant idea, that to remove licenses from a machine requires you to do it on the machine the licenses are activated on….\nWhich means, that since my WINE update changed my Machine ID i can’t remove the licenses from the now forgotten old Machine ID and need to send a request for all of the companies whose licenses i had on the machine, and ask them to reset those activation for me from their end so i can use them again.\nI seriously don’t understand why I can’t just remove the activation’s on the older machine using ILOK License Manager on a separate device without needing to be on the actual machine they are in, since I can do that very easily with all of my Arturia plugins…\nOr better, why cant some licenses be moved to the ILOK Cloud service, since that would be the best solution for me at this time, since now I need to remember to deactive all my ilok licenses everytime I tweak any WINE stuff, just in case my machine ID gets reset, just so I don’t need to wait a few days for all of the developers to accept my reset request 😠.\nBut at least I came across this issue a few days before the jam and managed to get my license resets before the jam starts and can start right away with everything working.\nStart of the jam/weekend #\rThe theme this around turned out to be 2 motifs provided by FoxHyode, instead of the usual artwork and word prompts that we can choose from to use as the main motif(s) the base our tracks on.\nMotif 1: #\rMotif 2: #\rSince i love me some motivic stuff, as soon as I saw the theme I wanted to try and use both of the motives in a single song since It was not really specified that one can’t use them both.\nMy initial idea was to first play the motive in it’s proper as provided from when it first appears in the track just so listeners can hear “Ah, this it the Motif 1!”, and then start playing around with the motive a bit more, by changing the rhythms and other fun stuff.\nFirst section: #\rFirst thing i started with was the Motif 2, and came up with this melody where the first parts are the motif as is and then a second half which is something new/different playing around the short then longer note figure i took from the motif and should hopefully help them feel connected to it and a bit to the Motif 1 since it shares the same thing, just as a long then short figure.\nFor the instrumentation I went with a String section doing the backing harmony and a Flute and Harp playing the melody, and a Celeste and Children’s Choir adding some atmosphere on the latter half\nSecond section #\rFor this next section I wanted to use Motif 1, so I can then start playing around with both of the motives after showing them in the provided form first.\nThis time i tweaked the motif slightly, but might actually change this later to just match the motif 1:1, but right now felt that it would feel too boring if this part also just started with the 1:1 of the motif + I wanted it to fit the 6/8 time of the first section.\nFor the second section i went with a lighter feel, with just the strings playing the melody first in the cello’s and then passing to the violins that get harmonized later by the second violins, and the celli and basses playing a rhythmic bass pattern to add some more rhythm (maybe a bit too annoying with the staccatos, might just change them to sustains later..) and a repeating chordal waltz rhythm on the harp and celeste to have a constant beat.\nWhat i got done on the first morning session during the first day (Saturday): #\rAfter the initial 3 hour morning session I took a break and came back to work for a few hours during the evening/night and came up with an idea for a sort of action/combat section based on the motifs, but it was a bit late already so i just recorded a improv around the idea on my midi keyboard and if it still sounded good the next day, I would start arranging that.\nThe piano sketch, which i quantized to the grid (didn’t remove any bum notes so the bad playing is pretty audible 😉): #\rOn the second day (sunday), I didn’t manage to do much, other than to start arranging the action sketch from yesterday a bit with some string staccatos along side some percussion to add a bit more interest.\nStill really rough as is, but thinking of maybe adding some Woodwinds to play melodic stuff, or maybe just taking the melody away from the strings and adding that to the woodwinds or maybe the brass, since the brass play the motif in the transition as sort of war horns.\nWhole thing after Day 2: #\rNext week #\rOn Monday and Tuesday I didn’t do much other than adding some percussion, woodwinds and brass to the action part, and then also tweaked the reverb to be a bit smoother/less boomy.\nSince i wanted to keep the action section from being too bombastic, I wanted to use brass pretty lightly, so I only added some trombones playing some harmony to works as a kind of pad to help make the mid register feel a bit more fuller.\nI also added a Flute and a Piccolo Flute playing some doubling and runs to the later part of the section to help make it feel like its moving forward/building up.\nI had a pretty solid percussion base already, but after talking to a friend he mentioned about adding a snare drum, so I added a snare accenting the rhythm with some rolls at parts to give a bit more “march” esque feeling.\nAfter tweaking the reverb it feels a lot better than before, but still needs work in setting up the “virtual space” properly, which I got some good tips for in the jam discord that I’ll try to get right after I get the composing work done on this or I will get sidetracked with that and forget about actually finishing the track 😂.\nMonday/Tuesday progress: #\rSeems like the export had an issue since there is some audible popping in the audio, but not so annoying that I would be arsed to open the project to export a new file 😁\nThursday/Friday progress #\rOn Wednesday I got a bit bored/stuck with the orchestra stuff I had been working on, so I decided to do what I always do in these cases and started doing something completely different in style.\nI felt like trying out some chiptuneish stuff so I took the midi from the action section I’d been working on the prior days on put those on some nes sounds (Magical8bitPlug vst).\nThe whole retro vibe that came from the chip sounds got me really inspired and made me decide to go forward with a NES esq soundpalette.\nNow that I was going for the chiptune I remembered I had RPGMAKER VX ACE on my steam account from when it was a free some time ago, and decided to try and make a short little jrpg game as a sort of in-context demo for all of the music.\nI’ve done a couple of demo games before on Godot, but I’m not really a programmer, so I haven’t retained any knowledge of all the coding I’ve done on those 😂. Luckily since RPGMAKER is pretty much a Lego building type of thing, even a non coder like me can make something on my own pretty quick.\nI found some free assets on itch.io after searching a bit and started building the game, so making some levels and events to make it feel like there an actual progression to the game play.\nWhile working on the demo game, the sort of visual feedback i got from making stuff in the engine, I got inspired and managed to get a boss tune and a track for the final shrine/chamber area + VICTORY! and GAME OVER jingles\nLater I managed to get the demo game in a state where it was some form of a playable experience,\nFirst iteration of the in-context demo, with the new boss and shrine track: #\rSaturday #\rI had tracks for all the areas/things in the game now, but still needed a track for the main title screen that comes as you boot the game. I’ve been using FoxHyode’s 2 motives almost somewhere on all of the tracks, but I was a bit undecided on whether to have the title music melody have just be one or both in the full form, or something that has bits of them in the theme.\nI decided to use the first motive as the base for the main title music, but somehow it ended up sounding too dark to be used in the main menu and was more like a dungeon theme or something.\nSo because of that, I added an additional area to the demo between the shrine and the outside where you have to defeat to Elder One’s lackey before you can go up the stairs to the shrine and have the new music be the bgm for that area.\nIf the submissions didn’t have a 5 min max time limit, I might’ve tried writing a new boss track for the Elder One and used the existing boss track for this enemy, but since I would be going over the limit, the music for this fight is just the basic battle theme.\nIn-context demo with new area and “dungeon” music: #\rSunday #\rSpent a couple of hours in the morning trying to come up with a new tune for the title screen, and after a while i got something i was somewhat happy with and decided to stop there, then come back later with fresh ears to hear how actually bad it was 😁.\nAfter listening back to it later in the evening, I felt that the latter part of the track felt really off to me and started tweaking that.\nAfter the tweaks It felt pretty good to me, so I decided to test it in the actual demo game to see how it felt.\nIt’s not really as bombastic as I initially imagined what i would make for the titles, but felt pretty good to me in-context!\nI then added a little story text scroll before actual gameplay, to try and give some info on how to actually progress/finish the context demo game.\nI’m still not sure if I’m uploading this anywhere, since the version of RPGMAKER I’m using (VX ACE) does not support html/web export, so raters and anyone wanting to give it a try would need to download the really sketchy looking GAMENAME.EXE file that would then extract the game files to a directory they choose 😂.\nBut as things are now, I’m probably going to submit what I have now tomorrow, but first I’m going to get my volume levels/mastering uniform.\nFinal test before submitting? #\rSubmitting day! #\rSo, most of the tracks felt pretty OK to me, so all that was left was mastering everything and recording the gameplay footage of the context demo rpg game.\nWhile doing the mastering I felt that I could tweak the FOREST track a bit, but now as I write this after submitting, I realized that I actually fucked with the loop a bit, and now the loop still works, but it’s slightly jarring. What’s done is done i guess 🤷‍♂️.\nI also decided to whip up sheet music for the tracks in Musescore, but that ended up taking an hour, since the program crashed randomly when doing undo/ctrl+z.\nI’ve used musescore before in linux with no issues and it performed better than on windows, at least on my machine (musesounds glitches a bit on windows, but works stellar in linux for some weird reason).\nI’m guessing that I’ve done something wrong when I installed it and should reinstall it, but didn’t want to start doing that with the deadline closing in, so I tried to work around the crashing and managed to get the sheet music done.\nAfter I got the sheet music done, I made a quick video for the tracks with the demo game title screen for the graphics/art and recorded the in-context demo so people don’t have to download the game to their PC (especially since the .EXE file looks sketchy as hell, at least to me 😂)\nNow I was pretty much done and went to upload and submit the project, and after that I started writing the submitting day segment of this devlog (so what you are reading right at this moment👋).\nFor some closing words for this jam, I have to say that doing the little context demo game really fun and I wouldn’t have wrote as much music as I did without working on that alongside composing the music.\nI had a really good ebb and flow with doing something in the game for the music, that then gets me inspiration for a new track or some tweaks and then vice versa from that.\nI’ve had sort of the same inspiration effects before on jams, i.e while writing devlogs like these, but this time it was a lot more.\nDay after EDIT: #\rThe next day after submitting I listened back to the youtube upload of the music and realized I had also fucked up the looping on DUNGEON and cut off a bar of rest from the end of FOREST, which is why it loop backs so jarringly…\nThe jam deadline got extended by 2 days, but since I already managed to submit before the extension, I decided to just keep the bad loops in and change the submission to go for the EASY difficulty instead of the HARD difficulty where the tracks need to be seamless loops (which FOREST and DUNGEON are not atm).\nAnd there were already a couple of tracks that were not meant to be loops, like TITLE SCREEN and the VICTORY! and GAME OVER jingles (I also forgot to show the game over bit in the demo game recording… 😅).\nFinal submission: #\rFinal in-context demo footage: #\r","date":"17 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757949741177-imptressions-mystery-1/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Impressions Composing Jam: Mystery #1","type":"blog"},{"content":"\rInitial setup #\rI’ve been playing around with making music on Linux every now and then with some jam projects, but after trying different distributions and learning about what I need to run some of my Windows software on Linux, I finally decided to take the plunge fully and try to swap fully over even if I had to give up some of the orchestral/acoustic sample libraries I couldn’t get running.\nI’ve tried to get the EastWest download/manager software working before using WINE, but couldn’t get the ui working correctly to install the libraries and Play engine. So this time around I saved my sample libraries to a different drive and kept the installers for the VST plugins, and to my surprise Play installed without a problem and the ILOK drm software they utilize works without a problem, so I could just tell PLAY where to find the samples and everything worked without an issue. It’s really unbelievable that this can actually work, and really shows the hard work that the WINE team and the creator/maintainer of Yabridge has done for it to be possible!\nI had gotten Native Access working before, but they’ve released a new version n3 that is not working with wine yet, but hopefully might work on a later WINE version.\nBut with Play working well I’m pretty much set for all the basic orchestral sounds but I still need to actually write a full piece using those to see how the performance is, since I don’t have any old projects to demo with since I used Cubase in windows for those and now use Reaper while in Linux since Cubase is not natively supported.\nSome resources/tools i used for setting things up: #\rFedora low latency setup guide/documentation by Audiojunkie on the LinuxMusicians forums - This is a helpful documentation on setting up Fedora for low latency work, best to read all the posts in the thread before doing any of the mentioned steps.\nYabridge - This is the most important thing in the whole setup, it works together with Wine to be able to use most windows vst’s on linux. The github page has a guide on how to set it up depending on your distribution.\nSeXan’s pipewire config script for reaper - This is a handy reaper script that opens a little GUI window in reaper to change the samplerate and buffer size for pipewire. You need to have the ReaPack repo manager extension installed and then import the repository with link from their github to ReaPack and then you can download the script called PipeWireConfig from there. After installing it you can make a button on the toolbar for it, add a keybind, or just call it from the actions menu when you need it.\nAudinux COPR repo - This is a user repository for Fedora maintained by Ycollette from the linuxmusicians forum with a lot of audio plugins/software in it so you can easily install them via your package manager\n","date":"6 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757949709680-start-of-the-linux-adventures/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Start of the Linux Adventures","type":"blog"},{"content":"\rDay 1 #\rStarted this jam pretty much the same way I do every time, meaning I started noodling/improvising ideas with piano while looking at the theme prompts.\nI pretty quickly got a little melodic figure that I liked and then improvised a sketch playing around with it, intending to take a break after that and continuing forward from the sketch.\nEnded up getting a bit side-tracked by the Anniversary update to Half Life 2, so didn’t work on the jam for the rest of the day.\nDay 1 Sketch: #\rDay 2 #\rDidn’t get any arrangement/instrumentation ideas for yesterdays piano sketch so I decided to start sketching a new track instead.\nPlayed around on the piano a bit and after a while I came up with this sort of “celtic” dance idea that I felt might be a bit too off theme for the jam, but I had decided to just go with whatever ideas I get since the jam is an “imagination” jam after all (usually I keep scrapping ideas until I get something that I feel fits the theme 😅)\nFor the arrangement I started out with testing how the melody sounded played by Violins, and I felt they worked great!\nIf I had the patience and skill working with samples, I’d really like for the melody have some gliding/portamenti at parts to amp the dance feel of the lead lines.\nThe rest of the arrangement was pretty much just simple stuff to support the lead line, with a pedal bass played by Cellos and Bassoons keeping the pulse going, while the percussion gives the overall groove to the thing.\nI recorded some claps and “shakers” myself to give a bit more organic feel to the percussion, I also thought about recording some vocal chanting stuff too, but decided to put the idea on hold for now and use some children’s choir sound the reiterate the melody near the end.\nLastly I added a little backing line to the second part of the track using a Pipa (Chinese Lute) and a Irish Low Whistle, but as of writing this text the next day, I feel that the Irish Whistle isn’t really audible enough because of its range, so I might just cut it out completely or use a higher whistle instead.\nAt this stage I felt the track had a pretty good amount of things going on, so the next step would probably be to think if the track is too short or not with its 1 minute runtime (I will probably keep it short, just to make rating easier/faster for people).\nDay 2 Sketch: #\rDay 3 #\rStarted a new track today as well since I felt that the day 2 track was in a pretty good state, and I didn’t get any more ideas to it.\nEvery idea I came up with today seemed to be really folky like my previous tracks, so I just went with the flow and started to work on the idea I liked the most.\nI improvised/sketched the ideas on a piano, but threw the midi on a nylon guitar sound to use as the base of this track for now. Intending to maybe change it to something else or re record it later to be more idiomatic for the instrument (which I probably wont, since I’m pretty lazy on those sort of things😅)\nSince the idea itself was pretty folky, I decided to go with a pretty minimalistic arrangement for this, especially since the previous track is pretty energetic.\nThe arrangement I ended up with consisted of just the guitar, some shaker, tambourine and whistling doubling the melody. After I finished working on the track for now and went to upload the current state to YouTube, as I was thinking of a name for the track, I came up with the name “The Roads Not Taken” and while googling the word I came across a poem called The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost, which gave me the idea of using a poem as lyrics for the track, making the track feel like something people sang while traveling the roads. The whole idea is sort of what I initially tried to do for the previous Ambience Jam, so might be fun to try it this time.\nDay 3 Sketch: #\rDay 4 #\rDidn’t work on the jam today, mostly just played around on the piano.\nDay 5 #\rLike yesterday, didn’t work on the jam today but managed to finish my playthrough of Half Life 2 (just the base game, will play episodes after the jam).\nDay 6 #\rBack to actually working on the jam after a slight side quest with HL2 😅.\nPlayed around on the piano a bit and came up with an idea for some sort of a combat track, that I will try to arrange tomorrow.\nDay 6 Sketch #\rDay 7 #\rBefore starting to work on the jam today I had listened to some old jrpg soundtracks, and that made me really want to use some retro/snessy sounds.\nI know all my tracks since now have been done with modern sounds, but I just really felt like using SNES sounds and as I mentioned before, I intended to go with the flow this jam and just do what I feel like doing as the feelings come😁.\nAfter making an arrangement of the piano sketch using SNES sounds, I really liked the feel of the sounds. I’m thinking about just switching all the previous tracks to SNES sounds too (I don’t have SNES samples of some of the instruments I’ve used, like the Pipa, but I guess I could make the sounds myself by resampling it?)\nDay 7 SNES arrangement of Day 6 Sketch: #\rDay 8 #\rWas feeling pretty unmotivated/lost on any new ideas today, but while i was playing World Of Warcraft before heading off to bed, I suddenly got the urge to try and do some ambient orchestral stuff like they have in wow.\nGot the basic idea pretty quick after i started, and managed to make this before ending for the day.\nDay 8 Sketch: #\rDay 9 #\rNo work on the jam today.\nDay 10 #\rTried to continue working on my previous tracks, but felt really unmotivated today too.\nTried to get some motivation going by taking my combat sketch and changing the sounds to a string quartet setup, which helped a bit to get some ideas/changes to it, but it’s still pretty barebones and short.\nFinal Day #\rSeems I got really stuck on all of my tracks after the initial day of working on them and couldn’t muster up the motivation to continue them any further, so all of the tracks except the main theme piano tune “The Far Reaches”, are really short just over a minute long.\nI was bit second guessing if I want to submit these at all since they are pretty short and unfinished to me, but in the end decided to submit them.\nHopefully on the next Impressions Jam I’ll be more productive 😅🤞\nFinal Submission #\r","date":"18 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757953243744-impressions-imagination-2/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Impressions Composing Jam: Imagination #2","type":"blog"},{"content":"\rDay 1 #\rAs soon as I saw the picture and text themes, I felt like doing some neoclassical inspired stuff would fit the themes this time around.\nI have been listening to Kirill Pokrovsky’s music a lot lately, so i originally thought about doing something a bit similar to how the music he made for the Divinity games sounded, but after improvising some ideas out in the daw I decided to change over to Musescore and maybe do the whole submission as 1 big suite type orchestral thing.\nThe reason i changed was mostly to get better at reading sheet music/notation + practising arranging and orchestration, since I never seem to have the motivation to actually start and finish any orchestral tracks if its not for a jam, which probably stems from being really inexperienced with orchestral writing 😅.\nThe prompts made me think of a game that would be something like the Souls series, where the death knight would be the final boss, or you would play as the death knight bringing death to some sort of immortal being/deities who would be the main bosses.\nSince I had recorded some improv stuff around some melody ideas in the morning, I started to come up with some stuff based on those.\nAfter a couple of hours i got a short foreboding introduction section that would probably be in a intro cinematic/scene of the army of the dead arriving + the beginnings of a second part, which would be a sort of battle tune.\nAt this point i felt I’d got enough done for today.\nDay 1 progress #\rDay 2 #\rDidn’t do much today, except a little stuff on the second part.\nMostly played Outward instead, which i can recommend for anyone who doesn’t mind a bit of eurojank in their games 😀.\nDay 3 #\rOnly did some piano sketching and slight tweaking in Musescore since i felt a bit uninspired today. Rest of the jam #\rHad some internet issues for the remaining days of the jam so I didn’t regularly update the journal, which means that the rest of this is written after the jam has already ended.\nFelt really uninspired to work on the stuff i had on started in Musescore, so i pretty much spent multiple days not really working on the jam at all.\nAfter a few days, I decided to do the same thing i did on the last Impressions jam and change the style to something totally different, since I really wasn’t feeling the fully orchestral stuff I was working on now.\nLast time i switched to some retro inspired electronic stuff, so this time I chose to do something power/symphonic metal inspired, and since I changed styles well early on instead on the last 2 days of the jam, I had thought I could do multiple tracks this time (strong emphasis on the “thought” word here 😅).\nI chose some 90’s Roland/Korg rompler sounds (JV-1080,Triton etc.) for my sound palette since I personally really like those sounds because of growing up with PSX and PS2 games that used them heavily. And after starting to play some improv stuff around the material i made in Musescore, I pretty quickly got this sort of a battle/boss tune going.\nInitially the track was just instrumental, with a band setup using electric guitars, bass, drums and all the rompler stuff for backing keyboard parts. But since i had wanted to add some vocals in the last jam but never came up with any lyrics i liked, I decided to go all in on the symphonic/power metal inspirations and try to do some vocals this time (also for singing/production practice).\nSince i usually just write stuff down on a text app on the computer, this time i tried to actually write any ideas about the track/jam on a physical notepad, and I felt like writing things down on paper really made my brain work a lot “better” this time around and got some lyric ideas going pretty quick.\nI went pretty unashamedly cheesy for the lyrics (keeping with the power metal tradition of kings,heroes and evil lords i guess 😂) and through that i got the idea for the new “game setting” this track would go in.\nWith the pretty cheesy fantasy lyrics i started to get going, i felt it would fit nicely in a arcadey 3d beat em up game in a fantasy setting, with the inspiration for this mostly coming from a PS2 game called Raging Blades/Raging Bless that i played a lot growing up. The game itself is a basic hack and slash/beat em up where you go through multiple stages, always fighting a mid boss and end boss in every level, all while having limited lives. It’s a pretty fun not too long game (especially fun while playing in co op) highly recommend giving it a try if you can.\nthe lyrics started a bit more serious, but after posting some in progress stuff on the jam discord devlog channel, DeltaFox mentioned something about goblins and that really lead me to make this a bit more goofier by adding a sort of backing choir to parts where i pitched the recordings up an octave to make them sound like some sort of goofy goblins.\nAfter i had about a couple of minutes of material in the boss tune, I started to try and get some other tracks going, which ended up in a sketch of a intro track to the game that starts of with a main “heroic” theme that then would morph with the 4 note motif for the army of death/death knight as they would show the army of dead attacking the kingdom.\nI didn’t complete the sketch, but later took the heroic theme from that and added it to the ending parts of the boss track, since I imagined the fight to have multiple phases with the heroic theme coming up in the last phase to add a bit more thematic oomph to the fight.\nAfter adding those parts I had to think of how I’m going to end the track, and I ended up just having the track building up and up to a pause, and then have short little resolution part that combines the heroic motif with the army of the dead/death knight motif in major to drive in the WE ARE VICTORIOUS feeling.\nListening to the track later, i felt that some of the vocal parts were a bit crappy compared to others and that the production on the vocals themselves was a bit crap too, but still better than some of my other earlier jam tracks like Thorns and Aerial i did during the RMCC jams.\nEven though I managed to get just this one track done, All in all i was happy, since I’d wanted to do some power metal inspired stuff before but never had the motivation to start and finish anything when it wasn’t for a jam 😅.\nFinal submitted track: #\rFinal lyrics #\rYou can pray, but, Death comes for all,\nNo one lives forever.\nYou can hide, but,\nDeath will find you,\nTake your soul away.\n———————–\nYou can pray,\nYou can hide,\nNo one’s coming, To save your life.\nYou can pray,\nYou can hide,\nNo one’s coming, So save your lies.\n———————–\nRemember you must die,\nDeath comes for all.\nNo one lives forever,\nDeath comes for all.\nRemember you will die,\nYou can pray or hide.\nBut, no one’s coming to save you,\nDeath is final.\n———————–\nSo, don’t be afraid sweet darling,\nDeath comes for all.\nYou may run, you may pray, you may hide,\nJust delay what’s to come­­­­.\nHe will come, He will find, He will take you,\nHe will make you understand.\nYou may pray, You may run, You may hide,\nBut you still must die.\n———————–\nWe will not hide,\nWe will not run,\nWe will stand and fight.\nWe will stay here,\nStand our ground,\nDeath will not come for anyone.\nSo, remember,\nWe will not die,\nDeath will not take anyone.\nSo, we will fight,\nFor whats right,\nSend Death back to where he belongs!\n———————–\nWe will not hide,\nWe will not run,\nWe will stand and fight.\nWe will stay here,\nStand our ground,\nDeath will not take anyone.\nSo, remember,\nWe will not die,\nDeath will not take anyone-\nSend Death back to,\nWhere he, belongs.\n———————–\nSo, we’ll fight,\nTill the daylight shines,\nOnce more,\nOnce more.\n","date":"5 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757953230023-impressions-ost-1/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Impressions Composing Jam: OST #1","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"6 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/alternative-soundtrack-jam/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Alternative Soundtrack Jam","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rDay 1 #\rAnother Nintendo game I’ve never played, nor have I listened to the soundtrack that much 😭. So I guess I’m going do this “my way” after listening to the original shop tune first, since I’m pretty sure I’m not going to be able to match the original score without really getting to know the style 😅.\nTook a listen to the track and decided to loosely take inspiration from it, mostly with using a banjo on my track like on the original + trying to get some of that 60’s/70’s music influence too.\nLoaded up some SNES style sounds from a fun cheap Kontakt library called Magical Box, starting first with a piano sound to sketch out some sort of a skeleton for my track before thinking about instrumentation.\nSince I got a bit stuck on the last Impressions Jam, I decided to input all the midi data by using the mouse instead of playing it in this time, hopefully coming up with something more fresh sounding instead of inadvertently playing the same sounding stuff I’ve done before.\nSince this a sort of opposites approach for me, I also started with the chords first and then figured out a melody to match the chords.\nAfter I had gotten the skeleton for one section ready I had the melody played by a banjo, and then after trying a lot of stuff I ended up with a Piano accompanying with the chords, a bass playing the bass line and a vibraphone outlining some chord tones + a hi-hat doing rhythm stuff.\nThe combination sounded pretty ok but a bit short so I repeated the section, but having a Hammond organ taking the lead this time around with the Banjo playing some mimicking accompaniment stuff at parts.\nAfter that, the first section felt pretty OK to me for now, so I started thinking about the second section, which I felt should be a bit contrasting to the first so the track doesn’t get too boring\nLike before I started out by sketching out a skeleton for the part on a piano sound, and after a bit felt that maybe I could have the part be a solo piano section.\nThe solo piano section felt like a fun idea, but I had a lot problems coming up with the part itself, since I wasn’t sure if it should just be some “solo” like riffing on the melody form the first section, or just a completely new B section that maybe has a bit of the same style/vibe as the first section.\nAfter a lot of screwing around with ideas, I ended up with a sort of a new part, with having the latter half copy the first section a lot to hopefully make it sound cohesive.\nI also had the piano change to comping on the latter half, with a Clarinet coming in to play the lead, doubled by the Vibraphone.\nI still feel the second part is not that great + probably needs a bass part, but at least I got a lot done on this first day.\nHopefully I won’t lose steam for the rest of the jam after such a good first day, like I usually do 😂.\nState of the track after the first day: #\rDay 2 #\rSpent the morning tweaking stuff that felt a bit crap after listening with fresh ears and added a bass line to the second section, but didn’t do anything else after that.\nDay 10 #\rSo I got a bit sidetracked with other stuff after the first two days, and didn’t work on the jam at all after that.\nSo because of that I’ll just submit the track as it is now, since It feels good to me as it is now, as a 1 minute loop.\nMade a quick video with the same graphics I’ve used on previous jams, uploaded that to Youtube and submitted a day early in case I forget to do that.\nFinal submitted track: #\r","date":"6 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757954661057-alternative-soundtrack-jam-5/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Alternative Soundtrack Jam #5","type":"blog"},{"content":"\rDay 1 #\rTime to do some atmospheric stuff I guess? #\rDecided to use Cubase for this jam, after trying/learning Reaper for some jams/couple of months now. And in true authentic Cubase style, I managed to get Cubase to crash after only an hour 😂\nCame up with a short 3 note figure/motif pretty quickly after starting to improv some ideas on a piano and started to sketch out some sort of a ambient/atmospheric track around a piano improv/sketch I recorded riffing around the 3 note motif I came up with.\nI doubled the piano sketch with a more Pad like sound to get a washy/dreamy sound and took an old woodwind/reed synth sound I had made in Vital some time ago, and tweaked it a bit to get this morphing drone sound which I put in the background of the track, holding down the root note of the key, so in this case C, as this sketch was in C Lydian.\nAfter getting some sort of an ambiance going with the effects and everything, I checked the jam discord and saw Kale’s post about how he was going to sing some norse poetry in his track and thought I could try something like that myself, so I looked up some Finnish poetry and decided to go with the poem Sydämeni Laulu by the “National Writer” of Finland Aleksis Kivi from his classic novel Seitsemän Veljestä (Mostly just chose one at random and Aleksis Kivi just because I share the same birthday with him 😄). I recorded a couple different takes of singing the first verse with different styles and then tried out different effects to make them sound, I guess dreamy?\nFelt I had done enough for today, so I stopped for the day.\nI’ve found that working for an hour or two on a track is the most productive period for me, since after an hour or two I don’t really get much done. So I usually take a break after an hour or two and come back later with fresh ears and usually feeling more creative.\nThe final state of the Day 1 sketch: #\rDay 2 #\rRemembered last night that I got the demo license for the Vienna MIR Pro 3D convolution reverb a week ago, so I decided to use that today to try and experiment with different distances between the sounds and instruments to get a nice “ambiance”, for which the MIR Pro turned out be really great and intuitive to use (its a bit pricy though, so not sure if I can ever justify spending that much money on a reverb😅)\nI also found a great sample pack for Kontakt at Pianobook called Folk Winds made by Hereafter Soundtracks. Pianobook is a community based website where people share sample libraries of instruments they’ve recorded, highly recommend checking it out if you’ve never been there!\nI really liked the Wooden Flute and Recorder that were part of Folk Winds and decided to use those in the track.\nAfter adding those to the project I felt that I had a pretty good amount of instruments to work with. Now the only thing left was actually to come up with an arrangement and parts for the different instruments, probably building on the sketch I’ve worked on for now or possibly taking the 3 note motif and other musical material and trying a new take on that.\nI also removed all the effects on the vocals that made them pretty unintelligible and only used MIR Pro to put them in a space with the other sounds. I’m still a bit 50/50 if I’m going to do keep the vocal stuff or not, but I will decide on that later in the arranging process.\nHow it sounded after the changes I made in the morning: #\rDay 7 #\rSo….. I didn’t work on the track that much since Day 2 because even if I tried to start working on it, I really wasn’t feeling it at all. So I made the decision to just start fresh with a new track in a totally different style/direction. Since I previously used mostly real/acoustic instruments I decided to do the opposite for this one and just use synthesizers.\nAfter loading up a synthesizer plugin with a pad sound, I first started to try and come up with some chord progressions since on the previous track I came up with the melody/motif first.\nSpent an hour or so of trying out different things and ended up with progressions for the main part and maybe a bridge section?\nAfter that I started filling out rest of the arrangement with a basic drum beat, bass following the root notes and some arpeggios outlining the chords.\nSince I’m more of a fan of the older electronic music styles than the modern EDM stuff, all the synth/drum sounds I used ended up being pretty retro/synthwavey.\nAfter I got the basic backing arrangement about done I started to figure out some sort of melody, thinking of using the motif from my previous track as the base somehow.\nAfter trying different things I ended up with this 2 part melody, first a 2 bar figure that repeats once while moving with the chords and then a contrasting second half with the same form of 2 bar figure that repeats, and I based it on the previous tracks motif.\nI got the base of the track at a pretty ok state now, so the next idea I had was to try and do some singing/vocal stuff for the lead melody but had pretty much 0 ideas on what to do for lyrics.\nI’ve tried coming up with lyrics using ChatGPT and other LLM tools before, but I’ve found that most of the stuff those come up with is very repetitive and trite. The only good thing about those is that I feel detached from the lyrics since the machine wrote most of them, thus making those easier to try and sing, since there’s none of that feeling of awkwardness I get from having written the words myself.\nWhile trying to come up with lyric ideas, I got some strong winter feelings from the chords and melodies, so I felt that the lyrics could be something about the themes of winter and maybe adventure since the track really felt like something from an old wintertime kid’s adventure movie 😂.\nBut seeing as I had started work on this track 2 hours ago and it was getting pretty late already, I decided to stop for the day and hopefully try and come up with some tomorrow.\nFirst sketch of the new track: #\rDay 8 #\rDidn’t do much today. Just tweaked the voice leading to flow better thanks to FoxHyode’s recommendations on the jam discord and tried out to come up with some lyrics (not much luck on that part😅).\nSince tomorrow is the last day for me, I’m probably going to just try and come up with something for the lyrics tomorrow and go with that even if I feel the lyrics are crap. So basically the same I did for the last jam, since I had the same issue during that 😄.\nDay 9 #\rEnded up just scrapping the whole idea of adding vocals since that seemed to be a big roadblock for me during this jam, and just chose some instruments and added some melodic parts with those instead. After that I had already gotten the mix sounding pretty ok to me, so now all I had left to do was get the volume of the track nice and loud. For the mastering part I used a plugin called bx_masterdesk by brainworx that I had snagged for free some time ago but never actually used it. I’m not a production pro but the plugin felt like some sort of a combination of a compressor, eq and other stuff, presented with controls named using basic terms so even an idiot like me can use it without reading a manual 😉.\nAfter I felt the volume was loud enough, I exported the track out as a WAV file and started to make the video for YouTube. For the video I decided to try and find a landscape painting of the northern lights during winter here in Finland, since that’s the feel/idea I got for the track from the text theme of “Spirits in the north“. After a couple google searches I found a nice landscape painting by the Finnish painter Werner Holmberg, called Revontulet, or Aurora as they’re called in English, put that as the video background and exported the video to YouTube.\nNow all that was left was submitting, so I’ll end my rambling here 😌\nFinal submitted track: #\r","date":"22 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757949722888-impressions-ambience-1/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Impressions Composing Jam: Ambience #1","type":"blog"},{"content":"\rDay 1 #\rFinally something that’s not a Nintendo game in one of these 😄.\nSince the game is a sort of rhythm game, I was thinking of going with a Symphonic Rock style + using some Chiptune/Rompler sounds too, since I feel that fits the visual aesthetic of the game (feels like it, at least to me).\nAs always I started out with sketching out some ideas/parts with a simple polyphonic sound (a basic synth square wave in this case), and after an hour and a half, I got 2 parts sketched out.\nAfter I felt that I couldn’t come up with anything else at the moment, I took a short break and came back a while later to listen to the sketches again and fixed some parts that sounded weird/off to me.\nAfter the fixes, I started to think about the arrangement and the instrumentation I was going to use. Since I had wanted to go with a more symphonic rock style, I looked at the Sprite Art of the Boss in question, and saw the instruments their design had and decided to try and use those for the track (Drumkit, Strings, Brass, Keytar and Electric Bass) + some Electric Guitars, since I wanted to use them.\nSince I had already sketched parts/lines beforehand, now it was mostly just arranging the parts to different instruments. After a while I had gotten some sort of an arrangement made, I felt a bit drained, so I decided to stop for the day and resume the next day.\nDay 1 state of the track: #\rDay 2 #\rTweaked some parts and the drums a little, but didn’t do that much to write about in detail.\nInstead of working on the track that much, I watched Aliens for the first time, which was great. Especially after having just watched Alien a couple weeks prior it was a great more Action oriented counterpart to the first film.\nI also started a new playthrough of Dragon Age: Inquisition, hoping to play through it again in preparation for the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. This time, playing a Sword \u0026amp; Shield warrior after having played initially through it as a Mage and then a second playthrough as a 2 Handed Warrior.\nDuring some tweaking later in the day, I finally found the reason for why the midi editor kept getting really laggy when there were too many notes visible, and it turned out to be that the note names displayed on the midi notes that were a bit too taxing for Reaper or My PC to display/draw so many of them at once. But after I disabled the “Show note names on notes” setting, everything was butter smooth again. If anyone reading this has had the same issues, I suggest trying disabling that option to see if it fixes the issue for you.\nVideo of the midi editor with the lag and after disabling showing of note names: #\rDay 5 #\rFor the last 2 days I didn’t work on the track at all, since I couldn’t really get any ideas for new sections to add to it. Because of that, I decided to just submit the track today, so I wont accidentally forget to submit it later.\nFinal submitted track: #\r","date":"10 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757954643007-alternative-soundtrack-jam-4/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Alternative Soundtrack jam #4","type":"blog"},{"content":"","date":"30 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/audio-production/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Audio Production","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rTrying to establish a Virtual Space with Reverbs? #\rFound a forum post talking about blending dry sounds with other more “wet” sounds by using Convolution reverbs with different IR’s recorded at different spots in a room as Busses you send your tracks to, and then control the send levels like you would a “mic mix” in a sample library.\nTook me a bit to understand the basic principles of how it works, but when I got it setup correctly, I found that it worked GREAT! The different “Mics” that you can mix felt much easier to tweak than using a reverbs Pre-delay values and whatnot to try and make things sound farther/closer away.\nI looked around for some Impulse Responses (IR) that had multiple positions of a room recorded and found an IR set of the Concert Hall in Pori, here in Finland, and those IR’s worked great on my first test sketch track I made to test this setup. Find them here.\nGoing to try and record some vocal stuff and try to get them to blend with the other sample sounds I have, which hopefully wont be too much of a headache with this “mic mix” style of reverb.\nAnother great resource for working with samples/mock-ups I stumbled upon, was this GDC talk by the Composer Wilbert Roget.

Then I listen back a bit later, and if anything sounds good to me, I start working on from that.\nSince the jam started on a Friday for me and I was going to have no time during the weekend, I made a quick sketch of a faux Bossa Nova track, after listening to a track from the Animal Crossing: New Horizons soundtrack.\nThe idea I had with this was that I would work more on this if listening to it after the weekend it still sounded OK to me, and stopped there for the day.\nSketch from Day 1: #\rDay 2\u0026amp;3 #\rDidn\u0026rsquo;t Work on the jam.\nDay 4 #\rNew attempt #\rTook a listen to my sketch from Day 1 after not hearing it since Friday, and I was really feeling uninspired to work on it any more, so i got another idea on the piano and started working on that.\nThis time I decided to go more in the \u0026ldquo;make it my way\u0026rdquo; direction, while keeping the guitar and upright bass that they use in the original soundtrack, but moving away from the Bossa Nova stylings and using a flute sound from Steinberg\u0026rsquo;s Halion Sonic that I really like, called \u0026ldquo;Expressive Flute\u0026rdquo; for the lead part.\nAfter getting a short sketch of what I was feeling, I stopped for the day.\nSketch from Day 4: #\rDay 5-9 #\rSort of giving up, I guess? #\rGot the same feeling with my Day 4 sketch as I did with my first one, so I was feeling really stuck on what I could really do, and thought about playing the actual game itself to get some ideas/inspiration on arrangement and other stuff for the track like I had done for the previous jam, by playing Metroid Prime.\nLast console’s I’ve bought were the PS2 and PSP since I mostly play on a PC, and I definitely wasn’t going to buy a Switch just to play Animal Crossing for the jam, so I looked to try playing via an Switch emulator but the performance was pretty terrible (laggy, 2-20 fps, literally unplayable) probably due to my CPU being a bit too old.\nSo I just decided to try some stuff every day hoping something sticks, but ultimately I really seemed to be uninspired on the arranging side of things this jam, so on day 9, I decided to just take my sketch of the track and play it again over a drumbeat and submit that, knowing that it does not really fit the vibe of the outside island area that much.\nA little final attempt to try get some ideas going on Day 9 below, that kinda turned out as the final submitted track with a second section added to it 😅: #\rThe singing/mumbling is what I usually like to do when thinking of lead parts/melodies, and sometimes I do the same thing with whistling instead.

Played the game for a bit, after which I booted up Reaper, loaded up a NES sound palette using the Magical 8bit plug VST, and started sketching ideas not really being too critical if it fit the theme or not.\nAfter I got a couple short sketches done, I took a break, after which I started working on taking those 3 sketches and tweaking/combining parts from them to make a new sketch based on some feedback I from other people.\nThe initial sketches were a bit too up-beat, so I tried to take the material and change some chords and lines to make it more dark, since the level is an underground level after all. But I somehow ended up turning what was initially a too up-beat track, to more of a Beat ’em up/Hack and slash track that really doesn’t fit Super Mario Bros., since its much too energized.\nSince I’d made some progress, I decided to stop for the day, and see how the track feels tomorrow.\nFinal sketch from Day 1: #\rDay 2 #\rSeems good to me? #\rListened to the Day 1 sketch again and thought it still sounded ok, even if its a bit more Metal Gear than Mario 😅 and started tweaking some things that felt a bit weird on my first listen + coming up with a new part to add to it.\nFelt the track was pretty high energy the whole time, so I came up with this calmer Bridge section that loops back to the beginning, but I feel could also be the intro to the track too, but I will probably just make a short stinger/jingle at the start of the track, that plays when you enter the underground and not when the track loops.\nI also tweaked the Triangle/Bass sound slightly, adding a pitch envelope that quickly slides down from up an octave when the note is played, giving it a bit of a kick drum like punch (going even further from the original Mario vibes😂). I also made another sound for the second pulse channel that has more attack to the sound, so that it can give more “spooky” vibes in the Bridge section.\nAfter I managed to get the new part and tweaks done, I decided to stop there, since I felt I had done enough for now.\nWhen I came back to listen to it later, I remembered, I think it was Nobuo Uematsu mentioning in an interview about how they got a sort of fake “echo” sound for the first Final Fantasy games on the NES, by playing the notes twice, the second one slightly after the first one is played, lowered in volume and slightly detuned. This makes a sort of fake echo effect that you can do all in the same channel if you have space to play the echo notes, if not then you need to use the second channel for that.\nI hadn’t tried that before, so I wanted to give it a try, even if I’m not trying to be accurate to the limitations of the NES, and I’m doing this in a DAW and not a tracker.\nAfter giving it a try on the pulse channel 1, I found it added a lot to the feel of the track, so I did the same to pulse channel 2\nSeemed like I got a good amount stuff done for the day, so stopped there.\nFinal state of the track on end of Day 2: #\rDay 8 #\rSubmitting time? #\rSo I didn’t really work on the track anymore after Day 2, since it felt pretty finished to me already. Only thing I was still thinking about, was the tempo I was going to use, since I was going between 130 or 160 bpm and couldn’t decide. After pondering about it for multiple days, I decided to just have the track at 130 bpm and then in Super Mario style the tempo would get a lot faster after time starts to run out (in this case 180 bpm). I added the faster version to the repeat/fadeout of the track after the little “fill” part, to demonstrate how it would work “in-game”.\nSince now it felt pretty finished to me, I decided to just submit it now , since I wasn’t going to do anything more to it.\nFinal Submitted Track: #\rDay 3-8 Reaper things #\rReaper setup stuff during the jam\u0026hellip; #\rAfter Day 2 I got a bit side-tracked in setting up a template in Reaper for the orchestral sounds I have (EW Hollywood Orchestra, old Play version).\nI’ve had a lot of issues in trying to learn how to properly use reverb to make a so called virtual “room” to get dry instruments to blend with other sounds, and just in general to get a sense of space on my tracks.\nSo I spent of most of the jam fiddling with reverbs to get a sort Mise en Place template where everything is already set up correctly, so that I can record, say some live vocals/instruments and it will blend with all the other tracks in the project, without needing to fiddle for an hour to get things to blend.\nI think got it somehow setup how I wanted it, but will probably still need to tweak/test things until its perfect (if it ever will be 😂).\nWhile building the reverb setup/template, I used the jam track to make some orchestral test arrangements so I could see how the reverb setup worked, so I’ll post them here too, in case anyone is interested to hear how the track sounds in a different arrangement.\nHere’s the two “virtual space” tests using reverbs, one using Solo strings, a Bassoon and Percussion in a Medium sized “space” + another one using Strings Sections, with some Brass, Woodwinds and Percussion in a Large “space”: #\r","date":"28 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757954632353-alternative-soundtrack-jam-3/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Alternative Soundtrack Jam #3","type":"blog"},{"content":"\rDay 1 #\rDeciding what to do #\rFor this jam I wanted to try and use an old electric organ I recently got for free, so I spent the first day trying different effects and other things to make different sounds out of the organ (by itself the stops on the organ sound like dusty Gameboy Square Waves), but didn’t really feel any of the things I tried so I decided to stop for the day\nWhat the organ sounds like without any external effects: #\rDay 2 #\rFound sounds I liked #\rDid some more effect testing, and came to the conclusion that using effects pretty lightly is the way to go, at least for the sort of sound I was looking for.\nI messed around in Reaper with some effects, and got a fun drone/pad sound by running the organ fully wet through the Dusk reverb by Saike. I also had Arturia’s Efx Refract before the reverb for a sort of bitcrushed unison effect to further crunch up the sound.\nThen tried out the Saike Protosynth synthesizer and got some sort of dusty pad sound that I liked, and tried out some the same effects I had on the organ on it, but ended up just using the Saike SEQS, which has a grid sequencer you can use to sequence the multiple effects inside the plugin.\nUsing the sequenced effects inside the plugin I managed to get a sort of pulsing bass drone that I liked.\nThis plugin I hadn’t tried before so it was pretty fun to just mess around without knowing anything about how to properly use it, and it turned out to be a really cool/fun plugin. If you use Reaper, I highly recommend taking a look at Saike’s plugins: https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=222750\nFor the last thing I tried the same plugin with some metallic percussion samples, but as of writing, I’m not really sure if I’m going to keep or scrap the idea.\nI also tried the Arturia Efx Fragments and reverb combo again, but this time switched the Dusk reverb to a more normal reverb, and tried to use the reverb to place the organ in a big space further away from the listener, also applying some low pass eq before the reverb so the organ would sound more mellow.\nAfter playing a bit with it, I really liked the sound as it reminded me a bit of the lo-fi organ sound in Ryuichi Sakamoto’s Async album (recommend listening if you haven’t before, it’s really a Vibe of its own).\nAfter that I ended for the day.\nTesting the sounds (some of the drone/pad stuff, and later solo organ): #\r## Day 3 ### Sound tweaking and a bit of sketching? Got some good feedback from Alex(Kale) in the jam discord about somethings I could tweak and add, so I mostly played around with some sounds again today.\nSo for today I added another background element in the form of a rhythmic piano, and made to sound a bit metallic with some effects,\nI also recorded some short rhythmic Aaah vocalisations that I made sound metallic with effects,\nand also recorded some plucks on a nylon guitar I sent through a pretty random set of effects to make an additional rhythmic element to go in the background (made use of the Saike SEQS again here, to get the rhythmic part of the effect chain)\nI also modified my effect setup on the electric organ, making it sound a bit closer in the “room” and adding a bit more power to it.\nOnly had an hour or so to work on the jam, but got suprisingly a lot stuff done.\nMy original plan for my track was going to somehow use the organ in some form as the base, and then come up with some lyrics to do some vocal stuff on top, as a form of singing practice.\nSince I have a pretty busy background already, I might try thinking of some lyrics tomorrow, but I’m pretty bad at writing/coming up with lyrics and stories, so will see if I end with anything like that before the jam ends 😅.\nSome demo of the new sounds, and the modified organ sound. #\rOne Reaper script that I found on the Reaper forums that I forgot to mention earlier, was the js_Mouse editing – Multi Tool script, which is a script that gives pretty much all the same cc/automation curve editing functionality that I’ve gotten used to in Cubase, in 1 script that I bound to the § key on my keyboard.\nHighly recommend this for anyone using reaper, absolutely love it!\njs_Mouse editing – Multi Tool script: https://forums.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=2211574\nDay 4 #\rDidn\u0026rsquo;t do any jam stuff\nDay 5 #\rCommitting, since its the final day? #\rSince the jam ends at 5 am tomorrow at my time, this is the final day for me to work on, and submit my track.\nI really tried to come up with some meaningful lyrics to sing as practice over this track, but I went in a far too ambient/droney style, so I couldn’t come up with anything fitting during the previous days.\nSo since it’s the final day for me, I just took a direction with the lyrics/words and went all in on what I chose, even if I liked it or not.\nI interpreted the theme words “The Light That Pieces the Darkness”, as a severely mentally ill person trying to hold on to their sanity, so I did the lyrics as almost a sort of spoken word chanting, more than singing. I felt that would be more appropriate, since the whole rest of the track is very moody and droney as it keeps slowly building up to the end.\nI wanted to make the voice stuff sound lo-fi/grungy like the other elements, but I’m not sure if I made it too lo-fi so that it became unintelligible, but it’s what it is I guess.\nThe whole idea for the lyrics came up really as I was going to give up and just submit the track without any voice stuff, so I’m not really happy with the delivery on the vocal parts and the mixing, but I ran out of time to keep doing re takes😅\nFinal finished/submitted track: #\r","date":"28 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/1757953272049-impressions-imagination-1/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Impressions Composing Jam: Imagination Jam #1","type":"blog"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"Finnish composer, writing music in varying styles.
