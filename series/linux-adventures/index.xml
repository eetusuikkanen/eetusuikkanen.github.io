      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;musescore-issues&#34;&gt;Musescore issues&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I switched over to Linux, I had been using Steinberg&amp;rsquo;s Dorico as my notation software, and had been really happy with it.&#xA;But sadly getting Steinberg software running in Linux via WINE turned out to be a pain in the ass, so I decided to just start using Musescore instead, since that one is a Linux native app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the whole user experience in Dorico is so well made, that using other apps after that feels really slow and cumbersome, because of the fast and easy workflow that Dorico has thanks to the Popover system they&amp;rsquo;ve created.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Musescore before, and made the sheet music for my last impressions jam submission using it, but it still feels a lot slower to use compared to Dorico.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m sure if I would keep using it, I would get a bit faster with it, but I encountered an issue that made me look for a way to keep using Dorico even if my main OS is linux.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-my-change-of-distro&#34;&gt;On my change of distro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So.. In my previous post I was using Fedora as my distribution, and that was because everytime I&amp;rsquo;ve demoed linux for a few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve always tried a new distribution each time and had already tried out &lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu Studio&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Manjaro&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;EndevourOS&lt;/strong&gt;  previously, So I decided to try out &lt;strong&gt;Fedora&lt;/strong&gt; for music production this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been running &lt;strong&gt;Fedora&lt;/strong&gt; on my laptop for a long time now and had used it previously for a server machine that I used to host a &lt;strong&gt;Mumble&lt;/strong&gt; voip server.&#xA;So naturally that made me want to test how easy/hard setting it up for music prodction would be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-setup&#34;&gt;Initial setup&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing around with making music on Linux every now and then with some jam projects, but after trying different distributions and learning about what I need to run some of my Windows software on Linux, I finally decided to take the plunge fully and try to swap fully over even if I had to give up some of the orchestral/acoustic sample libraries I couldn’t get running.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
