      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;trying-to-establish-a-virtual-space-with-reverbs&#34;&gt;Trying to establish a Virtual Space with Reverbs?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Found a &lt;a href=&#34;https://vi-control.net/community/threads/poor-mans-multi-mic-room-hall-reverb.133917/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt; talking about blending dry sounds with other more “wet” sounds by using Convolution reverbs with different IR’s recorded at different spots in a room as Busses you send your tracks to, and then control the send levels like you would a “mic mix” in a sample library.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Took me a bit to understand the basic principles of how it works, but when I got it setup correctly, I found that it worked GREAT! The different “Mics” that you can mix felt much easier to tweak than using a reverbs Pre-delay values and whatnot to try and make things sound farther/closer away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
