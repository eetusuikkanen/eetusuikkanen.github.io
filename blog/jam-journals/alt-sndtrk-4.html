        <h2>Alternative Soundtrack Jam #4</h2>
        <div class="date">10 September 2024</div>
        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        <p>Finally something that‚Äôs not a Nintendo game in one of these üòÑ.</p>
        <p>Since the game is a sort of rhythm game, I was thinking of going with a Symphonic Rock style + using some Chiptune/Rompler sounds too, since I feel that fits the visual aesthetic of the game (feels like it, at least to me).</p>
        <p>As always I started out with sketching out some ideas/parts with a simple polyphonic sound (a basic synth square wave in this case), and after an hour and a half, I got 2 parts sketched out.</p>
        <p>After I felt that I couldn‚Äôt come up with anything else at the moment, I took a short break and came back a while later to listen to the sketches again and fixed some parts that sounded weird/off to me.</p>
        <p>After the fixes, I started to think about the arrangement and the instrumentation I was going to use. Since I had wanted to go with a more symphonic rock style, I looked at the Sprite Art of the Boss in question, and saw the instruments their design had and decided to try and use those for the track (Drumkit, Strings, Brass, Keytar and Electric Bass) + some Electric Guitars, since I wanted to use them.</p>
        <p>Since I had already sketched parts/lines beforehand, now it was mostly just arranging the parts to different instruments. After a while I had gotten some sort of an arrangement made, I felt a bit drained, so I decided to stop for the day and resume the next day.</p>
        <h4>Day 1 state of the track:</h4>

        <h3>Day 2</h3>
        <p>Tweaked some parts and the drums a little, but didn‚Äôt do that much to write about in detail.</p>
        <p>Instead of working on the track that much, I watched Aliens for the first time, which was great. Especially after having just watched Alien a couple weeks prior it was a great more Action oriented counterpart to the first film.</p>
        <p>I also started a new playthrough of Dragon Age: Inquisition, hoping to play through it again in preparation for the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. This time, playing a Sword & Shield warrior after having played initially through it as a Mage and then a second playthrough as a 2 Handed Warrior.</p>
        <p>During some tweaking later in the day, I finally found the reason for why the midi editor kept getting really laggy when there were too many notes visible, and it turned out to be that the note names displayed on the midi notes that were a bit too taxing for Reaper or My PC to display/draw so many of them at once. But after I disabled the ‚ÄúShow note names on notes‚Äù setting, everything was butter smooth again. If anyone reading this has had the same issues, I suggest trying disabling that option to see if it fixes the issue for you.</p>
        <h4>Video of the midi editor with the lag and after disabling showing of note names: </h4>

        <h3>Day 5</h3>
        <p>For the last 2 days I didn‚Äôt work on the track at all, since I couldn‚Äôt really get any ideas for new sections to add to it. Because of that, I decided to just submit the track today, so I wont accidentally forget to submit it later.</p>
        <h3>Final submitted track:</h3>
